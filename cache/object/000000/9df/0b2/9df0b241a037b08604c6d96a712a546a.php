Wanting to help, he created TOMS, a company that would match every pair of shoes purchased with a pair of new shoes given to a child in need. One for OneÂ®.
 
Realizing that One for One could serve other global needs, Blake launched TOMS Eyewear in 2011 to help restore sight to persons in need with every purchase of sunglasses and optical frames. In 2014, TOMS Roasting Co. launched with the mission to provide clean water to developing communities with the purchase of premium coffee.
 
The most recent TOMS give is tied into the TOMS Bag Collection, launched in 2015, and helps provide safe births to mothers and babies in need through skilled birth attendant training and birth kits.
 TOMS is in business to improve lives. They identify global needs and create products to help address them. This simple idea is what makes TOMS more than a company â€“ theyâ€™re an evolving movement";}s:22:"ss_advertiser_facebook";a:1:{i:0;s:56:"https://www.facebook.com/TOMSunitedkingdom?brand_redir=1";}s:20:"ss_advertiser_google";a:1:{i:0;s:35:"https://plus.google.com/+TOMS/posts";}s:23:"ss_advertiser_pinterest";a:1:{i:0;s:31:"https://www.pinterest.com/toms/";}s:21:"ss_advertiser_twitter";a:1:{i:0;s:26:"https://twitter.com/TOMSuk";}s:24:"ss_advertiser_instragram";a:1:{i:0;s:27:"http://instagram.com/TOMSuk";}s:19:"ss_image_video_text";a:1:{i:0;s:122:"<iframe width="735" height="413" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zsmry84bARk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>";}s:7:"ss_logo";a:1:{i:0;s:79:"http://sosen.3doordigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/toms-logo1-380x250.jpg";}s:14:"ss_image_video";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"";}s:28:"ss_affiliate_advertiser_link";a:1:{i:0;s:133:"click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=RIYrAqooNEU&subid=&offerid=301770.1&type=10&tmpid=15868&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.toms.co.uk%2F";}}}
