According to George Tzenichristos, founder of Lipotherapeia, London‚Äôs only clinic dedicated to treating cellulite, its causes are 33% genetic and 66% lifestyle (so it can be improved), but it affects almost all women at some point. However, being inevitable doesn't mean we should give up trying to improve it any more than we should give up defuzzing our legs, defrizzing our hair or fighting wrinkles. But let‚Äôs be realistic.
<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Dismiss the myths.</em></strong> First, drinking water won‚Äôt ‚Äòflush‚Äù cellulite or any other form of fat (if it did, we‚Äôd never need to diet); and nor will body brushing, massage, special machines, creams, detoxing or even liposuction. Each may reduce cellulite slightly, and combining them may improve it even more, but they‚Äôre not ‚Äòcures‚Äô.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Defining it. </em></strong>Cellulite isn't just fat (otherwise tummies would look the same), but its dimply, orange-peel effect is due to how fat is stored in certain areas. Under the skin, the deeper tissues have a honeycomb-like structure made of collagen and elastin fibres, with fat stored in the honeycomb ‚Äòpockets‚Äô. When these fill up, the structural fibres begin to stretch, bulge and lose their shape, producing cellulite‚Äôs uneven appearance. Because men have tougher collagen - and less cellulite - hormones play a role. Consequently, hormone imbalances, the Pill, pregnancy, HRT and menopause also contribute.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Lifestyle factors</em></strong> that also contribute to cellulite include inactivity, smoking and a diet high in sugar, salt, carbs, fat, fried and processed food and alcohol. Weight-loss and even liposuction reduces overall fat, but won‚Äôt necessarily improve that dimply effect.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Exercise</em> is key</strong>, especially since female athletes have little or no cellulite. Since few of us can realistically exercise to that degree, vibrational power-plate-style technology can increase its benefits. <em>Worth trying</em>: <strong><em>Bslimmer Colours Vibration Massage Plate, ¬£169</em></strong> (medicarn.com)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Massage</em> </strong>also assists by improving circulation and providing smoother, less mottled colour, but even Manual Lymphatic Drainage, which largely benefits water retention, means you‚Äôll only look sleeker for a few days.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Exfoliating treatments</em></strong> - including body-brushing - makes skin look fresher, brighter and smoother, and also helps anti-cellulite ingredients to penetrate better. Sadly, though, it doesn't affect fat storage. If it did, we‚Äôd all be size 0.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Professional treatments:</em></strong> The latest VelaShape III VSmooth Ripple Remover combines bi-polar radio frequency and infrared technology for deep dermal heat and collagen-boosting, plus vacuum and lymphatic drainage massage to help smooth, firm, tighten and lift. Priced from ¬£200 per fortnightly session, a course of three is usually required for best results (www.ultra-vela.com)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><em><strong>Anti-cellulite creams </strong></em>provide anti-puffiness, firming, smoothing benefits using ingredients such as algae, butcher‚Äôs broom, carnitine, caffeine, green tea, ivy and raspberry ketone's. They all help slightly, with visible improvements within four weeks, but don‚Äôt expect miracles. <em>Worth trying</em>:¬†<strong><a title="SpaceNK.com" href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=RIYrAqooNEU&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=212245.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=11585&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fuk.spacenk.com%252Fbody-makeover-skin-firming-and-cellulite-treatment%252FMUK200015164.html" target="_blank">Cloud 9 Skin Solutions Body Makeover Cellulite Treatment, ¬£35</a>;
