Cookies are tiny text files stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages. They cannot harm your computer.

The cookie is used solely to help your browser process a website; it does not collect any information from your computer or snoop on your files.

Cookie files are typically stored in the cookie file of your browser. Each file normally contains:

The name of the website server that created the cookie

The duration of the cookie - how long your browser can use the cookie information to access the website that created the cookie

A cookie value - this unique information is normally a randomly generated number

The server that created the cookie uses the cookie value to remember you when you come back to the site or navigate from one page to another. Only the server that created the cookie can read and process the cookie. Cookies can expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window to when they exit the browser) or they can be stored for longer.

<strong>Why do we use cookies</strong>

At SoSensational, we do not sell products directly from our site.Â  Our income is derived from affiliate marketing networks which set third party cookies to enable them to keep track of the SoSensational site visitors who then visit their brands sites.Â  For example, if you like a product from John Lewis shown on our site, and click on the Buy Now button, it will go through to the John Lewis website.Â Â  If a purchase is made, it can be tracked back to SoSensational via the affiliate networkâ€™s cookie and we receive a small commission.

To order any products from any of our affiliate marketing merchants through SoSensational, cookies will need to be enabled.Â  Of course, you can disable them should you wish to do so, but we would be unable to sustain SoSensational without income.Â  If youâ€™d like to restrict, block or delete cookies from SoSensational or any other website, you can use your browser to do this.Â  Each browser is different so please check the help menu of your particular browser (or your mobile phoneâ€™s handset manual) to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

At SoSensational, we do not store personally identifiable information except the information given to us by you when registering to receive our newsletter or to enter a competition.Â  Please see our Privacy Policy for full details.

<strong>Hereâ€™s a list of the main third parties that set cookies through SoSensational, and what they are used for:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Affiliate networks, such as Linkshare and Affiliate Windows, as well as Skimlinks.Â  Please be aware that we donâ€™t control the setting of these cookies, so please check the third party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.</li>
	<li>In addition, if you take the opportunity to 'share' SoSensational content with friends through social networks â€“ such as Facebook and Twitter - you may be sent cookies from these websites. Again, we don't control the setting of these cookies, so please check the third-party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.</li>
