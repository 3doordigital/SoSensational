The wife of the second-term US president Barack Obama deserves the plaudits and the praise for her work, her sass, her intelligence, her ambition; for being a stand-out mother, wife, lawyer and for always looking fabulous.</h4>
But, really, all the "still fabulous at 50" stuff is really tedious and out-dated. What did we expect, somewhere overnight, between being 49 and 364 days and 50, she would turn into the woman at the end of Lost Horizon, who crumbles into dust?

And where did the notion come from that at a very specific point womenÂ  - always women, not men - dramatically and terrifyingly deteriorate into sex-less, shapeless, wrinkled crones who wear nothing but shapeless fleeces and have no interest in anything other than TV and a cup of cocoa.

When we see the Michelle headlines, and the latest "Kate Moss, still fabulous at 40", I suspect this whole idea comes from the newsdesk/picture desk of the red top newspapers, where some spotty, lard-assed 22-year-old suddenly wakes up to the idea that his gran, who is 44, is not necessarily the role model for the rest of female humanity. That there are not just some women but most women who progress through life on an upward and generally positive trajectory, working to stay looking good (without making it a full time job), who are grown up and gorgeous. Just like Michelle!

Get with the programme guys, and take a look around. She isn't an aberration - she's today's woman and SoSensational congratulates her!
