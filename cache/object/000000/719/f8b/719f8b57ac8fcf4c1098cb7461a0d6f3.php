Plus they make easy gift options if youâ€™re unsure of sizing as most come in Small, Medium or Large sizes. Weâ€™re loving the red chiffon babydoll from Emma Harris, the sheer Monroe Short Night Dress or the luxurious silk of French label Marjolaineâ€™s slips.

If your budget is already stretched this Christmas you can still taunt and titillate with intimate accessories from Petits Bisous like their delicious smelling massage candles and edible body paint.
