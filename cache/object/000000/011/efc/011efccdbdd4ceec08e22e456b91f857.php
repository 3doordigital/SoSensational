But sometimes a little black dress seems too safe or just too familiar.

When you want to give your LBD a new look or you want to make a statement, but red taffeta or purple sequins are too bold, the simplest and cleverest way to raise the glam quotient is with some gorgeous tights or hold ups.

You could also switch work-day opaques for something blingy and beautiful to transform a work outfit into something fit for partying.

Just add a pair of statement pumps, and a clutch and you will be party perfect for the festive season.";s:10:"post_title";s:19:"Glam up your LBD...";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:8:"glam-lbd";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-12-02 11:35:20";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-12-02 11:35:20";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"http://sosen.3doordigital.com/?p=54";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
