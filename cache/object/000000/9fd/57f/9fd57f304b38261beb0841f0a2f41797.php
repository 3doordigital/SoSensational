<h3><strong>It is the Number One online shopping destination with fashion and beauty carefully and thoughtfully edited for the grown up woman demographic. </strong></h3>
Founders Cyndy and Jan have been involved in fashion and style for many years and are passionate about passing on their knowledge and expertise to all grown up women via SoSensational.

The site covers all areas of fashion and beauty - from daywear to occasion wear; from petites to plus; from handbags to hats and jewellery, and features clever categories specifically for grown up women such as dress length, sleeve length and mature brides, as well as beauty pages showcasing the best anti-aging products.

SoSensational covers it all.

The <em>raison dâ€™etre</em> in selecting merchandise for the site is to help the grown up woman find the perfect addition to her wardrobe and to look effortlessly chic whatever the occasion.

Our team is constantly searching the catwalks and the high street so that we can showcase fashion that is always on-trend and fabulous - never frumpy - so that grown up women can find the fashion they want without having to trawl through thousands of inappropriate wisps of Lycra and teeny miniskirts.

SoSensational has many opportunities for you to put your brand in front of this discerning and cash-rich demographic (see article from The Times below). There are newsletters, competitions, blogs, our new Brands &amp; Boutiques pages, and so much moreâ€¦

<strong>" Spending led by the silver fashionistas</strong>

<strong>Â </strong><em>Britainâ€™s â€œsilver fashionistasâ€ are leading a high street boom, with women aged 50 and over spending almost Â£7 billion a year on clothes and accessories, according to a study.</em>

<em>Â In contrast, the amount spent on fashion by women aged under 50 is shrinking, the research by the analysts Kantar Workpanel showed. It hig-lights the growing importance of the spending power of the older market in areas that have traditionally been dominated by younger Britons. </em>

<em>Last year, women aged 50 and over spent Â£6.7 billion on fashion, up from Â£6.4 billion in the previous year, while those under 50 spent Â£9.5 billion, down from Â£9.6 billion in 2012.</em>

<em>Â This indicates that, after the economic crisis, it is younger women who are still cutting their costs while any consumer boom is coming from an older market.</em>

<em>The figures, based on regular surveys of 15,000 consumers, were published in the trade journal Marketing Week yesterday.</em>

<em>Daryl Humphreys, head of marketing at BHS said, â€œThe traditional age barriers are blurred and the belief is that customers of all ages are confident about fashion. Clever retailers are quickly adapting mainstream trends to all ages.â€</em>

<em>Older women are also canny consumers. About 42 per cent of their fashion expenditure is on items in sales and other promotions, Kantar said." </em>
