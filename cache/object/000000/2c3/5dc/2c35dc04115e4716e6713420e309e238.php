<p><a href="https://miami.wordcamp.org/2015/" target="_blank">WordCamp Miami</a>, one of the largest and longest running WordPress events in the US, is gearing up to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-miami-gears-up-for-6th-year-with-new-tracks-and-workshops-planned" target="_blank">celebrate its 6th year on May 29-31</a>. Last year the event brought together 770 attendees and tickets for 2015 are selling fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have sold over 600 tickets, and we see a sell-out on the horizon,&#8221; organizer David Bisset told the Tavern. &#8220;Our workshops are already almost sold out, and soon the weekend tickets will be as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>WordCamp Miami has adopted a strong educational focus for the event with an expanded array of workshops. On Friday, May 29, the organizers will host a BuddyCamp and a separate Front-End/Theme workshop. As <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-miami-kids-workshop-launches-the-next-generation-of-bloggers" target="_blank">last year&#8217;s kids workshop</a> was a success, organizers are exploring the option of adding a more advanced kids workshop that gets into coding.</p>
<h3>New &#8220;How To&#8221; Tracks and Mini-Workshops for Developers</h3>
<p>Bisset and his team received feedback from last year&#8217;s event indicating that attendees are interested in having more advanced developer talks. This year organizers are replacing the user track on Saturday with experimental &#8220;How To&#8221; tracks.</p>
<p>&#8220;To my knowledge, this is the first time a WordCamp has tried something like this,&#8221; Bisset said. &#8220;This track will focus on getting things done – almost like a mini-workshop focused on one or two concepts with step by step instructions &#8211; steps you can go home that night and do hopefully on your own.&#8221; Attendees of these tracks will be able to print out “cheat sheets” of each session and bring them to the conference or refer to them when they get back home.</p>
<p>The organizers are hand-selecting the speakers and requesting that they format their slides to be a lasting resource for users. Speakers will also move to the Happiness Bar to answer any questions in a non-rushed environment after their sessions are finished.</p>
<p>For the first time, WordCamp Miami will add an additional developer track on Sunday, which will consist of mini-workshops. In this format, two speakers will be give presentations on a single subject (back-to-back), so attendees will get multiple perspectives on the same subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, Andrea Rennick and Jesse Petersen will start off that Sunday with a &#8216;Genesis Framework&#8217; mini-workshop,&#8221; Bisset said. &#8220;Andrea will introduce the basics and concepts while Jesse afterwards will dive into more advanced topics on Genesis. There are also mini-workshops on building WordPress plugins, the WP-API, and more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Organizers are also reaching out to other open source communities to help forge connections across different projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first time, we have a Joomla developer coming to speak on Sunday and talk about Joomla, WordPress, and open source,&#8221; Bisset said. &#8220;We have been opening our doors to local Joomla and Drupal developers so we are excited about this presentation and hope it’s the start of something bigger for the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>WordCamp Miami is known for its excellent opportunities for networking and will maintain that aspect of the event in 2015.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides knowledge, networking has always been a key reason why people (local or not from the area) attend WordCamps,&#8221; Bisset said. Organizers are tailoring the after-party to be more of a &#8220;networking party&#8221; where attendees can continue their conversations from the event. Networking parties will take place on Thursday evening, Saturday night, Sunday for social breakfast, and a brief ice cream social Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>The new venue, Florida International University, is large enough to accommodate the 800+ attendees expected this year. All of the educational and networking opportunities during the 3.5 day event give attendees an incredible value for their tickets, especially for those who are traveling from a distance.</p>
<p>WordCamp Miami is an event that traditionally sells out every year and Bisset expects the same for 2015. The workshops will be limited to 100-150 people and tickets are going fast.

The screen, weight, size, and weird keyboard have captured my heart and I&#8217;m enjoying using the machine. It has replaced a 15&#8243; Retina Pro as my primary laptop for about 2 weeks now, with most of that being on the road.</p>
<p>For better and worse, it&#8217;s a lot like an iPad &#8212; the size and weight feel very natural in your life, and the screen is really gorgeous. It&#8217;s also not worth plugging anything into it besides its charging cable. It feels great to open and pick up right where you left off. The speed feels more than adequate for everything I&#8217;ve thrown at it so far, though I haven&#8217;t tried video editing or photo management outside of the new Apple Photos app. If there was a perfect iPad and keybard combo, it would feel and look like the new Retina Macbook.</p>
<p>The second thing I&#8217;ll say is I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this laptop for everybody yet. There are some trade-offs, for example I can get 5-6 hours from the battery but it&#8217;s a little shorter than I expected. It&#8217;s refreshing to have a computer that&#8217;s totally silent with no fan, and I&#8217;ve only had a heat warning once when it was sitting in hot direct sunlight for about 20 minutes. I moved into the shade because I was also wilting a bit from the direct LA sun.</p>
<p>The main reason I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;d recommend this Macbook right is hopefully ephemeral: USB-C. One of the very coolest things about the new Macbook is it charges (quickly) with a new standard called USB 3.1 with a Type-C connector, which is open for anyone to use, is reversible, and I think is going to be the future <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/02/usb-history-and-type-c/">as I&#8217;ve written about on this blog before</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-45021" src="https://ma.tt/files/2015/05/USB-type-C-840x321.jpg" alt="USB-type-C" width="840" height="321" /></p>
<p>Today, however, USB-C is bleeding edge. I actually have one other device that uses it, Google&#8217;s new Chrome Pixel laptop, but when you search on Amazon for &#8220;USB-C&#8221; there are almost no results except sketchy or not-in-stock generic things, and Apple doesn&#8217;t have any USB-C stuff in stock, even in their stores. (Perhaps related to the general stock issues <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/04/apple-loyalty/">I ended up writing about last time I tried to pen this Macbook review</a>.) I was able to get a cable that had male old USB and male USB-C on Amazon, that was pretty much it. The promise of USB-C is incredible: standard cables for charging everything super-quickly, a battery pack that could charge your phone or laptop, smaller power bricks, a next-gen Thunderbolt display with one cable for all data, display, and charging. You can see and imagine a really perfect ecosystem around USB-C, but it doesn&#8217;t exist today. <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/11/belkin-and-google-debut-usb-c-cables-including-low-priced-ethernet-displayport-hdmi-and-micro-usb-adapters/">Some cool stuff has been announced but isn&#8217;t coming until the summer</a>, even <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2903292/usb-typec-peripherals-are-on-the-way-and-storage-devices-are-first-up.html">thumb drives</a>.</p>
<p>The problem in one sentence: it is impossible to buy a cable, from Apple or otherwise, that let&#8217;s you plug an iPhone 6+ into the Macbook. They&#8217;ve announced but not shipped (to me at least) an adapter for old USB stuff (Type-A), but the last thing I need in my life is another dongle.</p>
<p>I thought I would miss this but in practice it has been a surmountable problem. Instead of using my laptop as a battery, I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://hellomerch.com/collections/wordpress/products/jetpack-battery-pack">using a battery to recharge miscellaneous electronics on-the-go</a>, and everything else including transferring photos from phone to computer is now happening wirelessly.</p>
<p><img class="  wp-image-45023 alignright" src="https://ma.tt/files/2015/05/apple-line-up.jpg" alt="apple-line-up" width="333" height="214" />I think the most perfect tech combo in the world right now might be a <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/10/retina-5k-mac/">5k iMac at home</a>, an iPhone 6+ as your phone, and the Macbook as an on-the-go device. (The iPad isn&#8217;t in my must-have list anymore.) The strengths of each of these products complement each other, and as Apple gets better about the cloud with things like photos, tethering, keychain sync, and continuity it&#8217;s really becoming a pleasure to use these products together. I also have an Apple Watch in the mix, but still forming my thoughts on that one.</p>
<p>The thing I might be most excited about is when some of the new tech in the retina Macbook around the keyboard, screen, trackpad, and battery is applied to their &#8220;Pro&#8221; series, which will probably be a bit more in my wheelhouse.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 04 May 2015 21:25:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>The Theme Review Team&#8217;s controversial decision to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options" target="_blank">require the use of the Customizer API for building theme options</a> unearthed a wave of criticism and concern about the capabilities of the customizer.</p>
<p>In response to more than <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options#comments" target="_blank">150 comments</a> debating on the topic, Nick Halsey, who has worked extensively on the feature in WordPress core, stopped by to offer a few words in support of the Theme Review Team&#8217;s decision:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many of the comments here are misinformed or unaware of both the full power of and the future importance of the Customizer. I’ve given an <a href="http://celloexpressions.com/blog/the-customizer-is-the-future-for-themes-and-theme-options/" target="_blank">overview of my perspective on my blog</a>, and while those views don’t directly represent the views of the WordPress project, I can say that most people working on the Customizer in core would agree with my points. Like it or not, the Customizer is here to stay, and ignoring that fact will eventually cause users to turn against you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Halsey&#8217;s post calls for theme developers to re-examine their philosophies when it comes to building complex UI options and stop re-inventing the wheel. He believes the customizer has more creative potential than developers give it credit for.</p>
<blockquote><p>Complaints about the amount of screen real estate available and the 300px default width show a lack of creativity and resistance for the sake of resistance to change. Start by removing all of the ads, external links, unnecessary branding, unnecessary options, and general clutter. Make your options self-explanatory – if you need a paragraph to describe what it does, it probably shouldn’t be a user-facing option. Do you still have so much UI that the experience is completely unusable? Try an outside-the-box solution, like utilizing the core media modal (header images and core media controls use it), a custom modal (theme details modal in core), or a slide-out panel (widgets in core and eventually menus in core as well).</p></blockquote>
<p>Prior to the Theme Review Team&#8217;s decision, documentation on theme development with the Customizer API was sparse and claims about its wide range of capabilities were difficult to support.</p>
<p>Resistance from theme developers has WordPress.org contributors scrambling to produce better documentation for using the customizer in themes. Over the weekend, Halsey created a canonical developer tutorial on the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/customizer-api/" target="_blank">Customizer API in the official theme developer handbook</a>.</p>

And left us dreaming how very fair<br />
It needs must be, since he lingers there.<br />
And you—oh you, who the wildest yearn<br />
For an old-time step, and the glad return,<br />
Think of him faring on, as dear<br />
In the love of There as the love of Here.<br />
Think of him still as the same. I say,<br />
He is not dead—he is just away.</p></blockquote>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 03 May 2015 16:34:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Nice to see an interview with Matt in the Sunday Business Post, but they got one thing wrong that Matt is not chilled out about!</p>

<p>Organizers of the very first WordCamp Belgrade are happy to report that the event was a smashing success. <a href="http://wptavern.com/a-glimpse-into-serbias-rapidly-growing-wordpress-community" target="_blank">Serbia&#8217;s rapidly growing WordPress community</a> started just two years ago with local meetups that became larger than some smaller WordCamps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our road from the first meetup back in April 2013 to the first WordCamp was brilliant,&#8221; organizer Milan Ivanović said. &#8220;Every WPSerbia meetup had no less than 100 people attending, with at least three speakers each.&#8221; Serbia was ready to host its first WordCamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were completely sold out about 10 days before the actual event, and it was such a shame that we had to turn down around 50 people who were asking for extra tickets,&#8221; Ivanović said. &#8220;We were limited by the venue and we couldn&#8217;t take more than 180.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attendees represented 13 different countries with the highest numbers from Serbia (73%), Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia. Those who came from other countries were treated to Serbia&#8217;s famous hospitality with tours and local cuisine.</p>
<p>&#8220;We dedicated some extra time for people who visited Belgrade for the first time to experience Belgrade and all of its beauties,&#8221; Ivanović said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is why we organized an unofficial after-after party that included a stroll through Belgrade&#8217;s main pedestrian street Knez Mihailova, a visit to Belgrade Fortress Kalemegdan, and dinner with true Serbian food and music in the most famous boem street Skadarlija.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The food was so good that I was afraid that this WordCamp wouldn&#8217;t be remembered by its talks and speakers but by the catering that all of us enjoyed,&#8221; he said.</p>

<ul>
<li>800+ bottles of refreshment served (on the first day)</li>

<p>Attendees received &#8220;<a href="http://wptavern.com/meet-wapuujlo-official-mascot-of-wordcamp-belgrade" target="_blank">Wapuujlo</a>&#8221; magnets and stickers to commemorate the event.</p>

<p>Videos from the WordCamp are already available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNn90HubD28a63SJu07vYZg" target="_blank">WordPress Serbia&#8217;s YouTube account</a> and will soon be uploaded to WordPress.tv as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as WordCamp Belgrade finished, the first thing I did was start plans for #wcbg2016,&#8221; Ivanović said.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wcbelgrade-organizers.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[42992]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wcbelgrade-organizers.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="wcbelgrade-organizers" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-43223" /></a>&#8220;The biggest outcome from this event was people asking how they can help organize the next WordCamp Belgrade, offering lots of different kinds of help &#8211; from finding new sponsors to offering their organization skills.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ivanović and the organizing team plan to at least double the size of the event next year. They are aiming for 400 attendees and two tracks of speakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we manage to organize an event that size, I think that would be an awesome test and a great intro for application to organize WordCamp Europe 2017,&#8221; he said.</p>

Prior to that time, new sellers were added via invitation only. A year ago there were only 300 themes available to WordPress.com users, but after having the marketplace open to new authors that count is up to 345.</p>
<p>Recently the <a href="https://theme.wordpress.com/join/" target="_blank">submission form disappeared from the site</a> with a message that WordPress.com would be keeping it temporarily closed in order to add new features that make the process easier.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/new-themes-wordpresscom.png" rel="prettyphoto[42345]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/new-themes-wordpresscom.png?resize=1025%2C736" alt="new-themes-wordpresscom" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43187" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://array.is/" target="_blank">Array</a> founder Mike McAlister recently published an <a href="https://array.is/a-year-in-review/" target="_blank">article</a> that detailed his experience selling on the WordPress.com marketplace. One of the main drawbacks was the lack of efficiency in handling the queue for new theme submissions.</p>
<blockquote><p>The review process on WordPress.com is long. I’m not talking about weeks long, I’m talking about months long. Each Array theme review has taken at least a month, usually longer. Our latest theme for WP.com, Camera, took four months from the day I submitted it to the day it was released.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to painfully long queues, theme authors have also been disappointed with WordPress.com&#8217;s recent lack of promotion for commercial themes. These factors contributed to McAlister&#8217;s decision to focus on promoting his products through more efficient distribution channels and <a href="http://wptavern.com/array-returns-to-themeforest-after-disappointing-experiences-selling-on-creative-market-and-wordpress-com" target="_blank">return to Themeforest</a>.</p>
<p>In April, WordPress.com theme author Sami Keijonen <a href="https://foxland.fi/toivo-was-not-approved-in-wordpress-com/" target="_blank">posted about his recent difficulties with the marketplace</a> after noticing that WordPress.com removed the submission form for new authors. He summarized some of the sources of confusion for commercial theme authors:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>WordPress.com basically stopped marketing commercial themes. (However, they do tweet about new themes.)</li>
<li>We have a private blog for themers but other than that, there isn&#8217;t any conversation between developers or WordPress.com staff. They did send a enquiry a while ago so that might help.</li>
<li>The review process takes months for commercial themes.</li>
<li>They seem to want really simple themes with simple design decisions. That’s fine by me but isn’t that kind of “forcing” the end user to like certain types of themes if they don’t have any options?</li>
<li>I would have wanted more accessibility-ready themes in WordPress.com like mine, but it seems that isn&#8217;t priority.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I contacted Automattic to find out why the submission form has been removed and when authors can expect for it to be re-opened. The company&#8217;s official statement indicates that opening up the marketplace was a temporary experiment and that there is no ETA for relaunching it.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s important to note that current WordPress.com sellers can submit new themes for possible launch. We’re not closed for new theme submission. We experimented with a public form for themes from new shops last year, and we had a ton of great submissions from theme shops around the world. We took it down last fall while we worked on getting ahead of all the new theme reviews that it created. We’ll put it up again but we don’t have an exact date in mind. We do still reach out to new shops with great themes. We’re always excited to find awesome theme shops.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company&#8217;s statement regarding the change in marketing clarifies that it is looking for new strategies to promote commercial themes.</p>
<blockquote><p>We may not do blog posts any more, but we haven’t stopped marketing premium themes. They’re featured prominently on <a href="https://wordpress.com/themes" target="_blank">wordpress.com/themes</a> and as part of our <a href="https://store.wordpress.com/plans/" target="_blank">Business Plan</a>. Plus, we’re exploring more ways to put premium themes in front of users.</p>
<p>In the future, premium theme shops can expect better feedback around the themes they submit, quicker launches, and more communication in general from the WordPress.com Theme Team. We’re excited about what we can continue to do for the world of themes with our sellers’ help.</p></blockquote>
<p>Automattic has no set time frame for launching these improvements, but it should be reassuring for commercial theme authors to know that the company is tackling the inefficiency that was bogging down the system. For the time being, new commercial theme authors looking to submit products to the marketplace are out of luck, but Automattic may decide to open it up again to continue the experiment in the future.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 01 May 2015 18:11:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>The total number of spam comments this month is <strong>4,167,247,500</strong> &#8211; just over four billion, which is still a big number even though it&#8217;s a slow month 😀. To help visualize this number, let&#8217;s say it takes a second to count each spam message. In that case, <strong>it would take 132 years and two months to finish counting</strong>.</p>
<p>As for ham &#8211; we saw a total of <strong>145,308,000 real messages</strong> come through. If we were counting each one of those, it would take only 4 and a half years to finish. As usual, there&#8217;s much more spam going around than real messages &#8211; only 3.4% of all messages sent this month were not spam.</p>
<p>We missed only about 1 in every 10,443 spams this month. If you are seeing spam in your comments, please mark it as spam &#8211; this will help Akismet learn from your input. Similarly, please mark any real comments that end up in the spam folder as &#8216;not spam&#8217;. If you&#8217;re seeing very many mislabelled comments, please <a href="https://akismet.com/contact/">contact us</a> about it and we&#8217;ll be happy to help dig into the issue.</p>

One of the first things I noticed after updating is the change to the Insert/edit link modal box. Instead of having to apply a title to the URL, the title is replaced with Link Text. The text that is highlighted before adding a link is automatically inserted into the Link Text box.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LinkmodalChange.png" rel="prettyphoto[43134]"><img class="wp-image-43135 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LinkmodalChange.png?resize=1025%2C301" alt="LinkmodalChange" /></a>WordPress 4.2 Add Link Modal on the Left WordPress 4.1 on the Right
<p>While I found this behavior to be annoying at first, it has quickly become one of my favorite changes. Adding links is quicker and more efficient. Several other people however, don&#8217;t like the change. WordPress user <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/Enticknap">Enticknap</a> created a <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32095">ticket on Trac</a> reporting the issue as a bug when in fact, the change was deliberate.</p>
<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/DrewAPicture">Drew Jaynes</a>, who led the <a href="http://wptavern.com/drew-jaynes-to-lead-wordpress-4-2">WordPress 4.2 development cycle</a>, explained <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32095#comment:5">why the change was made</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The &#8216;Title&#8217; field was intentionally removed from the wpLink modal in <a class="closed ticket" title="task (blessed): Include 'source anchor' in wpLink quicktags modal for improved ui/ux (closed: fixed)" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28206">#28206</a> largely because it was often confused with the actual link text itself.</p>
<p>In recent years, we&#8217;ve begun to actively discourage the use of title attributes in links as they are largely useless outside of providing the &#8220;hover tooltip&#8221; many visual users enjoy, and more importantly, they don&#8217;t promote good accessibility.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to continue using title attributes in links, you can add them manually using the Text mode in the editor.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several people took part in the conversation, explaining why the Title box is an important part of their work flow. Andrew Nacin, who helped design the original Link dialog, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32095#comment:22">said,</a> &#8220;I wish this is how it worked from the start.&#8221; Nacin described the Title attribute as an edge case and that its bad for accessibility.</p>
<p>The discussion was heated at times, but the conclusion is that the Title attribute will not be added back to the dialog box. Instead, users are encouraged to use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/restore-link-title-field/">Restore Link Title Field</a> plugin developed by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42/">Samuel &#8216;Otto&#8217; Wood</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/restore-link-title-field/">Sergey Biryukov</a>.</p>

<p>With the plugin activated, the Insert/edit link dialog is restored to how it was in WordPress 4.1. According to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/restore-link-title-field/">WordPress plugin directory</a>, the plugin is activated on 100+ sites. I asked Wood if there are plans to add additional features.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think adding new features is in the cards as there&#8217;s not much to add,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We might change it up as we fix some of the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32180">problems in core</a> causing it to be difficult to do properly.&#8221;</p>
<h2>WordPress is Continuously Evolving Software</h2>
<p>I sympathize with those who are upset that the Link Title attribute was removed from WordPress 4.2. If a feature you depend on in WordPress is drastically changed or removed, the first instinct is to be upset. It forces you to change your workflow and the change is often unexpected.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve traveled this path, but I&#8217;ve realized WordPress is continuously evolving software that tries to cater to the majority. Features removed from WordPress generally never go away as they&#8217;re replaced with plugins. A good example is when the ability to add borders and padding to images <a href="http://wptavern.com/common-issues-and-troubleshooting-wordpress-3-9">was removed in WordPress 3.9</a>.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AdvancedImageEditingOptions.png" rel="prettyphoto[43134]"><img class="size-full wp-image-21489" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AdvancedImageEditingOptions.png?resize=840%2C401" alt="Advanced Image Editing Styles" /></a>Advanced Image Styles
<p>This change lead to a lengthy discussion both on WordPress.org and <a href="http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/image-resize-1?replies=430">WordPress.com support forums</a>. Gregory Cornelius created the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-image-styles/">Advanced Image Styles</a> plugin which re-adds the ability to adjust an image&#8217;s margins and borders as you could prior to WordPress 3.9. According to the plugin directory, it&#8217;s active on more than 20,000 sites.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying you shouldn&#8217;t speak up when something you use in WordPress is removed. Rather, it&#8217;s a reminder that there is a way for everyone to get the features they want as WordPress core undergoes changes.</p>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/toivo-lite/" target="_blank">Toivo Lite</a> is a new theme on WordPress.org that features a bold minimalist design that really shines on mobile. <a href="https://foxland.fi/" target="_blank">Sami Keijonen</a> created the theme to be suitable for both business and blog sites.</p>
<p>Toivo is Finnish and it means &#8220;hope&#8221; in English. It&#8217;s one of a very small number of WordPress themes listed as <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/" target="_blank">accessibility-ready</a> in the official directory. Toivo meets the necessary <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/" target="_blank">guidelines</a> without compromising the overall design.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tovio-screenshot.png" rel="prettyphoto[43078]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tovio-screenshot.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="tovio-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43081" /></a></p>
<p>Toivo can be easily personalized via the customizer with the following built-in options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set header text color, background color, header image, and background image</li>
<li>Support for 3 navigation menus: primary, top, and social navigation</li>
<li>Select from 3 different layouts: 1 column,  2 Columns: Content / Sidebar, 2 Columns: Sidebar / Content</li>
<li>Edit the front page callout title, text, and URL</li>
</ul>
<p>With Jetpack active, the theme has additional features for custom content support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload a logo</li>
<li>Show your testimonials</li>
<li>Display portfolio items</li>
<li>Add infinite scroll to your blog</li>
</ul>
<p>Toivo is Keijonen&#8217;s sixth theme accepted to WordPress.org. In the past he has often built on top of the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core" target="_blank">Hybrid Core</a> framework, but this theme uses only select parts, including the <a href="https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/blob/master/classes/hybrid-media-grabber.php" target="_blank">Hybrid Media Grabber</a> (a script for grabbing media related to a post), a stripped down version of Schema.org markup support, and the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/plugins/breadcrumb-trail" target="_blank">Breadcrumb Trail</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can still use best parts of Hybrid Core and make decisions based on theme I’m building,&#8221; Keijonen said. &#8220;Toivo is slimmer with fewer translating strings, and has less code to handle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keijonen said that branching out has helped him to understand every line of code and have more control over the theme.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have learned most of my WordPress theme knowledge from Justin Tadlock,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Theme Hybrid is still the only community I feel I belong. It is the place where you can learn, be yourself, ask help, have opinions, and get feedback. But in a way I have grown out of it; it&#8217;s like a moving-from-home experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toivo was rejected when submitted to WordPress.com, but Keijonen is known for his tenacity and continual experimentation with design and distribution approaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have plans to fork the theme, create church and charity themes out of it, and sell it on Themeforest if they allow it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A year ago, Keijonen conducted an <a href="http://wptavern.com/the-mina-olen-free-wordpress-theme-experiment" target="_blank">experiment</a> wherein he made his commercial Mina Olen theme available for free on GitHub to see if it would affect its popularity and sales for support. The results were positive overall, and Keijonen now has more commercial products available on GitHub. To date, he has earned $5,304 from the WordPress.com version of Mina Olen and 2,142€ from sales of the self-hosted version.</p>
<p>Getting Toivo approved on WordPress.org was the next step in his theme development journey and Keijonen reports that the experience was &#8220;fast as a shark&#8221; this time.

Ünver is 27 years old and a <a href="http://tutsplus.com/authors/baris-unver">Tuts+ author</a> living in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. In the article, Ünver describes what it&#8217;s like to live and work in Turkey. When asked whether WordPress being blocked in Turkey is a regular occurrence, he responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s not extremely common, but we experience downtime on large websites like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter a couple times each year. WordPress.com is actually one of the first websites that was <a href="http://ma.tt/2007/08/blocked-in-turkey/" target="_blank">blocked back in 2007</a>—you can read the story here.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are other interesting tidbits within the article as well such as the number of people who know how to use VPN&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s common knowledge.

<p>WordPress 4.3 development <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/04/28/wordpress-4-3-kickoff/" target="_blank">kicked off</a> this week with release lead <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/author/obenland/" target="_blank">Konstantin Obenland</a> at the helm. The main focus of this release will be to improve the experience of using WordPress on touch and small-screen devices. Contributors will also be renewing efforts to improve the Admin UI and the Network Admin UI, particularly as it relates to the experience on narrow screens and responsive list tables.</p>
<h3>Customizer Design and Architectural Improvements</h3>
<p>The customizer will also be getting some attention. Weston Ruter <a href="https://weston.ruter.net/2015/04/29/customizer-features-for-wordpress-4-3-kickoff/" target="_blank">published</a> a summary of the three areas he proposes tackling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customizer Partial Refresh:</strong> This <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-partial-refresh/" target="_blank">feature plugin</a> aims to refresh parts of a Customizer preview instead of reloading the entire page when a setting changed without transport=postMessage.</li>
<li><strong>Customizer Transactions:</strong> This proposal is dependent on the Partial Refresh and involves re-architecting the customizer to make way for the possibility of feature plugins like scheduled settings, setting revisions, and drafted/pending settings.</li>
<li><strong>Customizer Concurrency/Locking:</strong> This <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31436" target="_blank">proposal</a> would add concurrency/locking support to prevent multiple users from overwriting each other&#8217;s changes while working in the customizer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nick Halsey also has a few ideas he is proposing for iterating on customizer development that was completed in 4.2.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to aim for adding theme install in 4.3, which would require a shiny install process, and shiny updates could work into that well too,&#8221; he said. Halsey is aiming to have a functional and tested proposal ready before the scheduled time to decide on which features to merge in to 4.3.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also hoping to renew work on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31336" target="_blank">Customizer UI design changes</a>, which would separate navigation from the options UI by removing accordion behavior for a better experience. It will be interesting to see how these changes, if selected to merge into 4.3, affect theme developer&#8217;s <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options" target="_blank">adoption of the customizer</a>.</p>
<h3>Better Passwords Coming to WordPress 4.3</h3>
<p>Mark Jaquith will be spearheading an effort to improve password creation in WordPress 4.3 and discussion will take place in the <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core-passwords" target="_blank">#core-passwords</a> channel on Slack. The first leg of his proposal would make “user chooses own password” non-default so that a user can choose his own password or opt to allow WordPress to generate one.</p>
<p>Jaquith is also proposing that the <a href="http://wptavern.com/ridiculously-smart-password-meter-coming-to-wordpress-3-7" target="_blank">password strength meter</a>, added in WordPress 3.7, offer feedback on why a user&#8217;s selected password might be measured as weak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Simple feedback like &#8216;too short — add more characters!&#8217;, &#8216;Try adding some numbers and symbols!&#8217;,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;Not only that, we could actually make the addition for them, show them their password attempt with some additions that would make it better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, Jaquith proposes adding an option to make the password entry visible, eliminating the need for entering it twice. The fourth and final leg of his password improvement proposal is a major and long-overdue step toward improving the security of WordPress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let’s not send passwords via e-mail anymore; it’s insecure,&#8221; he said &#8220;We’re not getting around &#8216;full access to e-mail means you can reset,&#8217; but we can stop passwords from sitting around in e-mail accounts forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contributors are aiming to release WordPress 4.3 on Tuesday, August 18th. Follow the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-3-project-schedule/" target="_blank">project schedule</a> for approximate dates for feature merge, betas, and release candidate(s).</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 17:19:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The PHP based script downloads and updates a copy of the latest stable version of every theme in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/">WordPress.org theme directory</a>. Devin Price put the script to good use and has <a href="http://wptheming.com/2015/04/theme-repository-data/">published a series of data points</a> related to the theme directory.</p>
<p>It took Price 112 minutes to run the script and download nearly 4GB of theme code. In his report, Price answers the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many themes are based on Underscores?</li>
<li>How many themes are on WordPress.org?</li>
<li>How many themes have <em>lite</em> in their name?</li>
<li>How many themes use the latest WordPress functions?</li>
<li>How many themes add an options page?</li>
<li>How many themes use a bundled options framework?</li>
<li>How many themes use TGM Activation?</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Many Themes Support the Customizer?</h2>
<p>Last week, <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options">we reported on a significant change</a> to the WordPress theme directory guidelines. Beginning on April 22nd, themes submitted to the WordPress.org theme directory will have to use the customizer to build theme options. Themes already hosted in the directory have six months to comply before the Theme Review Team will enforce the new requirement.</p>
<p>By searching the directory for themes that use <code>$wp_customize-&gt;add_control</code>, Price was able to determine that <strong>761 themes</strong> or <strong>23.8%</strong> currently support the customizer. The low number coincides with Justin Tadlock&#8217;s assessment <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/04/22/details-on-the-new-theme-settings-customizer-guideline/">that adoption has been slow</a>, especially when you consider that it was added three years ago to <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.4">WordPress 3.4</a>.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that after the six month cutoff date, themes not using the customizer will still be able to be downloaded from and hosted on the directory. However, the theme code can not be updated unless it follows the new guidelines.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what the data looks like three months from now as it would indicate how many and how fast, themes are adopting the customizer. Price is taking requests for what data you&#8217;d like to see, but if you want to do the research yourself, Jorbin&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/aaronjorbin/WordPress-Theme-Directory-Slurper">Theme Directory Slurper</a> is available for free on GitHub.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 23:16:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p><a href="https://gopostmatic.com" target="_blank">Postmatic</a> publicly launched its email-based commenting service today and is now officially out of beta. The free <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/postmatic/" target="_blank">plugin</a> aims to increase comment engagement by allowing readers to subscribe to new posts/comments via email and leave comments by simply hitting reply.</p>
<p>Postmatic also launched a <a href="https://gopostmatic.com/premium/" target="_blank">commercial service</a> alongside version 1.0. For $9/month customers can add additional features, including guaranteed mail delivery for thousands of subscribers, fully responsive HTML email for posts and comments, support for oEmbed and shortcodes, and the ability to moderate comments from your inbox.</p>
<h3>The Challenges of Sending Bulk Email</h3>
<p>Since Postmatic is critically dependent on email delivery, founder Jason Lemieux and his team didn&#8217;t want to hassle with attempting to send it themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sending bulk email is really difficult to do correctly so we’ve partnered with folks that have already solved it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All posts, comments, and otherwise are sent through a combination of both <a href="http://www.mailgun.com/" target="_blank">Mailgun</a> (by Rackspace) and <a href="https://www.mandrill.com/" target="_blank">Mandrill</a> (by Mailchimp).</p>
<p>&#8220;This takes all of the uncertainty out of the equation and makes sending WordPress content to lists of tens of thousands of subscribers as easy as pie. Users don’t need to sign up for accounts with these services, change their dns or anything &#8211; we handle it all for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lemieux reports that Postmatic had 1,200 sites in its beta program, ~500 of which they considered highly active. The individual installations were the easy part of the beta. Supporting the subscribers, which are more numerous, was the greatest challenge the team encountered.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/direct-reply.png" rel="prettyphoto[42986]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/direct-reply.png?resize=259%2C500" alt="direct-reply" class="alignright size-large wp-image-43052" /></a><strong>&#8220;During beta we delivered posts and comments to roughly 46,000 unique subscribers and processed nearly 15,000 incoming comments</strong>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These numbers are pretty small so we’ve built a system that scales and are ready to open the doors to everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notifications sent from Postmatic are two-way transactions designed to invite further discussion in comments, so the team has to be able to adequately support the myriad of email clients that people are using.</p>
<p>&#8220;Email is complicated and as old as it is, it still seems like the wild west in a lot of ways,&#8221; Lemieux said. &#8220;We have to make sure that the post being delivered to an old-timer using Pine on his home-built Linux box communicates ideas just as well as the same post when seen in Gmail or on an Apple watch. Then we have to accept comment replies from all of these sources as well, which it turns out you can do. With a watch. Leave a comment. Go figure.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The Future of Postmatic</h3>
<p>Postmatic is a micro-startup that is mostly self-funded. Approximately 10 months before starting, the team knew that they wanted to be ready to quit their jobs when the time came.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were fortunate to be able to squirrel away much of the funding we needed while also building it in tandem with our usual client work,&#8221; Lemieux said. &#8220;When we entered beta last fall and saw the reaction people were having to commenting by email we chose to stop taking on new client work, bring in a small amount of private funding, and go at it full time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Postmatic&#8217;s tiny four-person team is what made this possible. Two members are full-time and the other two are currently part-time.</p>
<p>As part of their quest to seamlessly join email and commenting, the team deemed it important to launch with <a href="http://wptavern.com/postmatic-now-supports-1-click-migration-of-subscribers-from-jetpack" target="_blank">importers for Jetpack</a>, Mailpoet, and Mailchimp. This makes the transition easier for site administrators who are already hooked into more traditional comment subscription services. Postmatic also has a few more high priority items on the roadmap.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first is to support sites with high publishing frequency by enabling digests,&#8221; Lemieux said. &#8220;We have some fantastic ideas about how to do this in the new world of email commenting that will be of huge benefit to publishers and readers both.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we move into the world of professional publishing we’ll also need a diversity of templates. Rolling in a template library or template builder is the plan there. Both of those things are next on our list.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team behind Postmatic is investing heavily in 100% email commenting because they believe that innovation in WordPress comments is long overdue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every comment system needs email to some degree,&#8221; Lemieux said. &#8220;Livefyre, Disqus, Jetpack &#8211; all send an email notification (if subscribed) that a new comment has been posted. But you still have to jump over to a blog to reply and post a comment. It&#8217;s not always possible to do so, nor is it easy on mobile &#8211; which has become so important.</p>
<p>&#8220;Postmatic takes that out of the equation &#8211; notification leads to reply, leads to blog comment, in one seamless action. Why wouldn&#8217;t you want email commenting to work like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Email commenting and post notifications are available in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/postmatic/" target="_blank">free plugin</a>, but these features are just the beginning of how Postmatic is aiming to revolutionize WordPress commenting.</p>
<p>&#8220;The debate about the usefulness of comments in WordPress rages on while email marketing and automation has become a very hot area,&#8221;  Lemieux said. &#8220;But really the WordPress comments system is an email automation platform just waiting to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about what it&#8217;s like to participate in comments without ever leaving your inbox, Postmatic has a <a href="https://gopostmatic.com/2015/04/try-the-magic-right-now/" target="_blank">live demo</a> available where you can try it out.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 16:33:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Contributors on the <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API" target="_blank">WP REST API</a> project have released <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/releases/tag/2.0-beta1" target="_blank">version 2.0 beta 1</a>, named after Simpsons character <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9MTejMEUJU" target="_blank">Ralph Wiggum</a>. This release is not backwards compatible with version 1, but project lead Ryan McCue  <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/04/29/wp-rest-api-version-2-0-beta-1/" target="_blank">assured developers</a> that it is a direct continuation and that the fundamentals of the API haven&#8217;t changed.</p>
<p><a href="http://v2.wp-api.org" target="_blank">Documentation for version 2</a> is now in progress, starting with basic schema docs, and the site has a section that outlines the <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org/changes-beta-1.html" target="_blank">changes in 2.0 Beta 1</a> internals and externals. It also includes an <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org/changes-beta-1.html#migrating-endpoints-from-v1-to-v2" target="_blank">example</a> for migrating endpoints from version 1 code to version 2.</p>
<p>Compatibility with future beta releases is not guaranteed and this release comes with a note of caution for testers:</p>
<blockquote><p>While we believe the API is now stable enough for public testing, we may continue to break the API in the future as we improve it further. Only use the API in development, and do not use version 2 in production environments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Version 2.0 beta 1 had 23 contributors and many generous companies donated employee time to the project. This is a major milestone for the WP REST API on its journey to being proposed for inclusion in WordPress core. Check out the project&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues/571" target="_blank">core merge plan</a> to follow the progress and view steps as they are completed.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 05:42:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

We received a tip from a reader that the plugins will soon be retired. When browsing to any of the six plugins on WordPress.org, the following message is displayed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Retiring on June 2015. JP plugins will not be maintained after the end of June 2015. Thanks for everyone who used these plugins. Special thanks for those who gave good ratings.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked Sulaiman why he&#8217;s retiring his plugins at the end of June. &#8220;As I said in the interview in 2014, I make sure my projects stay alive when I can no longer work on them. Now, I can hardly find the time to keep JP plugins up to date; hence, I posted that notice in the hope that someone from the community would step up and take the wheel,&#8221; he responded.</p>

He remains hopeful that the person is still motivated. &#8220;Anyways, if no one would seriously pick up JP plugins, I&#8217;m considering updating them every six months, or perhaps quarterly or so. After all, there are 4000+ users who are counting on them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>I suggested that he add the <a href="http://wptavern.com/adopt-me-plugin-tag-is-now-in-use-on-wordpress-org">adopt-me tag</a> to his plugins to increase the chances an interested party will take them over.

Some are <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/">WordCamps</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.meetup.com/">meetups</a>, and others are WordPress specific but don&#8217;t use the WordCamp branding. Until now, there has not been an easy way to see all WordPress events on one page. <a href="https://managewp.org/">ManageWP.org</a> has <a href="https://managewp.org/articles/9696/launching-wordpress-events-hub">launched</a> a WordPress <a href="https://managewp.org/events/">Events Hub</a> which displays WordCamps, meetups, and non-WordCamps on the same page using a map overlay.</p>

<p>Vladimir Prelovac, Founder and CEO of <a href="https://managewp.com/">ManageWP.com</a>, explains why he created the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was travelling the US last year and wanted to see what WordPress events I could attend along the route and there was no elegant solution to this problem. WordCamp Central lists only WordCamps without a map showing their location. There are also numerous meetups as well as non-WordCamp conferences like LoopConf, CaboPress, ThemeConf that are not listed anywhere. So I decided to build it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Only registered users to ManageWP.org are able to create new events. On the event creation screen, there are fields to add an event&#8217;s address, name, type, date, URL, Twitter account, and Twitter hashtag. You can also add speakers as well. I found creating a WordPress meetup a little confusing since I had to set a start and end date.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CreateNewEventScreen.png" rel="prettyphoto[42960]"><img class="size-full wp-image-42980" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CreateNewEventScreen.png?resize=994%2C838" alt="Event Creation Screen" /></a>Event Creation Screen
<p>I think the event type should be the second field underneath the event&#8217;s name. I&#8217;d also like to see a set of fields or options added that are specific to the type of event being held. For example, if it&#8217;s a meetup, there&#8217;s no reason to have an end date. Instead, the end date should be replaced with an option to set a time.</p>
<p>There should also be a way to configure repeating events, similar to how Meetup.com does it. This way, I don&#8217;t have to remember to edit the event&#8217;s details every month. Events are not moderated, allowing submissions to appear immediately on the map.</p>
<p>As the number of WordPress events across the world increases, it&#8217;s nice to have a resource that unites them on one map. In future iterations, it would be cool if users could create an itinerary. The itinerary would be saved to the user&#8217;s account and would be sharable through a URL. This way, users could get together and plan a road trip together.</p>
<p>Prelovac is keeping a close eye on the comments of this post, so after you check out the events hub, please leave your feedback in the comments.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 19:33:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>In light of the WordPress Theme Review team&#8217;s recent decision to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options" target="_blank">enforce the use of the native customizer</a> for themes in the official directory, the folks behind the Redux and Kirki frameworks are joining forces to better support developers for the new requirement.</p>
<p><a href="http://reduxframework.com/" target="_blank">Redux</a>, which is built on the WordPress Settings API, is one of the most widely used options frameworks for themes and plugins, with WordPress.org reporting 90,000+ active installs. It supports a multitude of field types, custom error handling, and custom field and validation types, but is not currently compatible with the Customizer API.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where <a href="http://kirki.org/" target="_blank">Kirki</a> is stepping in to offer a framework for <a href="http://wptavern.com/kirki-a-free-plugin-to-style-the-wordpress-customizer-and-add-advanced-controls" target="_blank">advanced controls using the customizer</a>. Kirki, created by <a href="http://aristeides.com/">Aristeides Stathopoulos</a>, makes it easy to style the customizer to be a more natural extension of your theme and add panels and sections with more than 20 different <a href="http://kirki.org/#field-types" target="_blank">field types</a>.</p>
<p>Both open source frameworks and their developers will be <a href="http://redux.io/" target="_blank">working together</a> to offer &#8220;the most powerful WordPress frameworks under one roof.&#8221; They are currently working on making the data output the same as well as creating a converter API for Redux developers. The eventual goal is that Redux will cover both custom settings panels as well as the customizer, while Kirki will be focused purely on the customizer.</p>
<p>Redux lead developer <a href="https://twitter.com/simplerain" target="_blank">Dovy Paukstys</a> was one of the most vocal opponents of the decision to make the customizer a requirement for WordPress.org theme options. His position is that it limits developers and cannot provide a complete replacement for the Settings API.</p>
<p>&#8220;The announcement of April 22, 2015 regarding the requirements for WP.org theme submission bothered me,&#8221; Paukstys said. &#8220;I had a decision to make; work to make Redux work fully in the customizer, or reduce our community.</p>
<p>&#8220;I then remembered the Kirki project and decided to ping Ari. We discussed the possibility of bringing Kirki into the Redux organization and progressing from there.&#8221; Kirki is joining Redux as part of the team, but it will be maintained as a separate framework.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirki will always be light, with a smaller footprint,&#8221; Paukstys said. &#8220;There are no plans to turn Kirki into the Swiss army knife that Redux is. However, Kirki will be modified slightly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Redux and Kirki teams plan to share concepts and development time in order to ensure that they can mirror the data output between the two frameworks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am also in the process of creating the Kirki API, which will allow Redux devs to take their current config and use it with Kirki, rather than Redux,&#8221; Paukstys said. This will enable developers who have built themes using Redux to easily port their theme options over to Kirki for compatibility with the customizer.</p>
<p>Eventually, Redux will support both custom options panels using the Settings API and the customizer. In the meantime, Paukstys took the initiative to partner with Kirki to make sure Redux users won&#8217;t be hung out to dry with the new WordPress.org requirements.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirki is a great solution for Customizer only themes,&#8221; Paukstys said. &#8220;There&#8217;s room enough on our team for both frameworks. Both serve a unique audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Along with about a million other people I bought and read the authorized biography, and didn&#8217;t think it portrayed Jobs in a way that made me think any less of him, but there must have been some things in there that someone who knew him closely felt were so off that as a group they decided to coordinate and speak with a new author to set the record straight, as Eddy Cue said of the new <em>Becoming</em> book, &#8220;Well done and first to get it right.&#8221; I will never know who Steve Jobs really was, but it is interesting to triangulate and learn from different takes, especially Isaacson&#8217;s biography that Jobs himself endorsed but might not have read and this new one promoted by his closest friends, colleagues, and family.</p>
<p>As an independent third party who doesn&#8217;t know any of the characters involved personally, I must say that I felt like I got a much worse impression of Steve Jobs from <em>Becoming</em> than from the authorized biography. It was great to hear the direct voices and anecdotes of so many people close to him that haven&#8217;t spoken much publicly like his wife Laurene &#8212; he was a very private man and his friends respect that. But the parts where Schlender/Tetzeli try to balance things out by acknowledging some of the rougher parts of Steve&#8217;s public life, especially the recent ones around options backdating, anti-poaching agreements, book pricing, (all overblown in my opinion) or even when trying to show his negotiating acumen with suppliers, Disney, or music labels, they make Jobs look like an insensitive jerk, which seems to be the opposite of what everyone involved was intending.</p>
<p>The direct quotes in the book could not be kinder, and it&#8217;s clear from both books that Jobs was incredibly warm, caring, and thoughtful to those closest to him, but <em>Becoming</em> tries so hard to emphasize that it makes the contrast of some of his public and private actions seem especially callous. The personal anecdotes from the author are the best part: one of the most interesting parts of the book is actually when Jobs calls Schlender to invite him for a walk, as one of the people he reached out to and wanted to speak to before he passed, and Schlender &#8212; not knowing the context &#8212; actually chastises him for cutting off his journalistic access and other trivia, and then blows off the meeting, to his lifelong regret.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tragic, and it&#8217;s very <em>human</em>, and that&#8217;s what makes for great stories. No one suggests that Steve Jobs was a saint, nor did he need to be. His legacy is already well-protected both in the incredible results while he was alive, and even more so in what the team he built has accomplished since his passing, both periods which actually amaze and inspire me. <em>Becoming Steve Jobs</em> tries harder and accomplishes less to honor the man. It is worth reading if, like me, you gobble up every book around the technology leaders of the past 40 years and want a different take on a familiar tune, but if you were only to read one book about Jobs, and get the most positive impression of the man and his genius, I&#8217;d recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004W2UBYW/">Isaacson&#8217;s <em>Steve Jobs</em></a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 16:44:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>This morning we reported on an <a href="http://wptavern.com/zero-day-xss-vulnerability-in-wordpress-4-2-currently-being-patched" target="_blank">XSS vulnerability in WordPress 4.2</a>, 4.1.2, 4.1.1, and 3.9.3, which allows an attacker to compromise a site via its comments. The security team quickly patched the vulnerability and <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/" target="_blank">released 4.2.1</a> within hours of being notified.</p>
<p>WordPress&#8217; official statement on the security issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>The WordPress team was made aware of a XSS issue a few hours ago that we will release an update for shortly. It is a core issue, but the number of sites vulnerable is much smaller than you may think because the vast majority of WordPress-powered sites run Akismet, which blocks this attack. When the fix is tested and ready in the coming hours WordPress users will receive an auto-update and should be safe and protected even if they don’t use Akismet.</p></blockquote>
<p>That auto-update is now being rolled out to sites where updates have not been disabled. If you are unsure of whether or not your site can perform automatic background updates, Gary Pendergast linked to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/background-update-tester/" target="_blank">Background Update Tester</a> plugin in the security release. This is a core-supported plugin that will check your site for background update compatibility and explain any issues.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/" target="_blank">Akismet</a> is active on more than a million websites, the number of affected users that were not protected is much smaller than it might have been otherwise.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.1 is a critical security release for a widely publicized vulnerability that you do not want to ignore. Users are advised to update immediately. The background update may already have hit your site. If not, you can update manually by navigating to Dashboard → Updates.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 19:46:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Over the weekend, Theme Review Team member Jose Castaneda posted a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/04/26/changelog-proposal/" target="_blank">proposal to add change logs</a> to themes hosted on WordPress.org. The discussion has been on the table for years, but renewed interest in change logs is surfacing for the upcoming 4.3 and 4.4 release cycles.</p>
<p>Adding changelogs to themes requires action on two related tickets: a <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45" target="_blank">meta ticket</a> to add support for change logs on WordPress.org and a <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22810" target="_blank">core ticket</a> to expose the changelog file to users in the WordPress admin.</p>
<p>Castaneda&#8217;s proposal requests that the team select a standard format for theme authors to follow in either the readme.txt file or a new changelog.txt file. From there the team would follow the core development release cycle to complete whatever steps necessary to get changelog support added to WordPress.org themes.</p>
<p>Theme Review Team members are divided on whether or not change logs are beneficial to users, as they already have the ability to detect changes using a .diff file when authors submit updates. Others find change logs to be a more readable addition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personally, I find change logs to be incredibly helpful, even when using a .diff,&#8221; Theme Review Team admin Chip Bennett said. &#8220;The changelog is the human-readable summary of changes, that can really help grok the diff changes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justin Tadlock isn&#8217;t convinced that WordPress users would benefit from themes including change logs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Honestly, I don’t see change logs as all that important from a user standpoint. While I don’t have any official stats, I’d wager that the vast majority of users don’t read change logs and, of those who do happen upon one, don’t understand most of what’s actually in the file.</p>
<p>Change logs are, by and large, a developer tool. It’s a nice-to-have feature. I don’t care one way or another. I never read them. I doubt we&#8217;ll get great change logs from the majority of theme authors. We can’t even manage to get some semantic versioning down or basic inline PHP docs. We’ll probably see a lot of Git commit logs copied/pasted or my personal favorite, “Changed a bunch of stuff. Too busy building awesome s*** to care about tracking changes”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Active discussion on the topic is taking place on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/04/26/changelog-proposal/" target="_blank">make.wordpress.org/themes</a> blog. If the team concludes that change logs are beneficial, the main question to answer is whether or not they should simply take up residence in the readme.txt file, like plugins do, or have their own separate file.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the issue boils down to whether or not WordPress users read and appreciate changelogs, or if they are more beneficial for developers. As the Theme Review Team is primarily made up of developers, it would be valuable if average users who desire theme change logs could chime in on situations where the file might be helpful.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 15:36:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<blockquote><p>If triggered by a logged-in administrator, under default settings the attacker can leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server via the plugin and theme editors.</p>
<p>Alternatively the attacker could change the administrator’s password, create new administrator accounts, or do whatever else the currently logged-in administrator can do on the target system.</p></blockquote>
<p>This particular vulnerability is similar to one <a href="https://cedricvb.be/post/wordpress-stored-xss-vulnerability-4-1-2/" target="_blank">reported by Cedric Van Bockhaven in 2014</a>, which was patched in the most recent <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-1-2-is-a-critical-security-release-immediate-update-recommended" target="_blank">WordPress 4.1.2 security release</a>. That particular vulnerability was related to four-byte characters being inserted into comments, causing premature truncation by MySQL.</p>
<p>In this instance, an attacker posts an excessively long comment in order to trigger the MySQL TEXT type size limit, which truncates the comment as it is inserted into the database.</p>
<blockquote><p>The truncation results in malformed HTML generated on the page. The attacker can supply any attributes in the allowed HTML tags, in the same way as with the two recently published stored XSS vulnerabilities affecting the WordPress core.</p>
<p>In these two cases, the injected JavaScript apparently can&#8217;t be triggered in the administrative Dashboard so these exploits seem to require getting around comment moderation e.g. by posting one harmless comment first.</p></blockquote>
<p>A patch from the WordPress security team should be forthcoming. At this time the team could not provide an ETA, but in the meantime there are a few things users can do to mitigate the risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your best option is to install Akismet (which has already been configured to block this attack), or disable comments,&#8221; core contributor Gary Pendergast said in response to <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1430134328007948" target="_blank">inquiries on the WordPress #core Slack channel</a>. &#8220;JavaScript is blocked by wp_kses(). Akismet blocks this specific attack, which gets around wp_kses()’s protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>WordPress users can also temporarily disable comments in the meantime until the patch has been issued by the WordPress security team.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 12:10:22 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking about applying to work for <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, you might want to <a href="http://davemart.in/2015/04/22/inside-automattics-remote-hiring-process/">read this article first</a>. Dave Martin, Creative Director at Automattic, published an in-depth look behind the scenes of the remote hiring process for the design and growth portion of the company. He explains the five step process in detail which gives future applicants a good idea of what to expect.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fascinating read and I learned that every part of the process has a purpose. For instance, every trial project consists of work that would normally be completed by existing exmployees. Every question asked by Martin in the interview process has a purpose, whether it&#8217;s to glean information or get a feel for how the applicant communicates.</p>
<p>The one area of the hiring process I&#8217;ve routinely seen scrutinized by those who don&#8217;t make the cut is the lack of specific feedback on why they&#8217;re not a good fit for a position. Dave Clements, who <a href="https://www.davidclements.me/2014/04/01/experience-trial-automattic/">almost made it to the final stage</a> of the hiring process, criticized the lack of detail from Automattic on why he wasn&#8217;t a good fit.</p>
<blockquote><p>My only criticism of my whole process from start to finish is that I wish they would have gone into more detail into on why I was not a good fit for them. They had been so verbose and open up to that point about any question that I asked of them, but when I asked why they had come to the decision to not move forward, I was given a fairly generic response as they &#8216;couldn’t go into too much detail&#8217;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Martin tries to do his best to highlight why someone is not a good fit, but the process is not easy and the number one goal is to hire the best people.</p>
<blockquote><p>If things don’t end up working out, I’ll do my best to highlight why. At this point the applicant has invested quite a bit of time. I try to be as specific as possible as to why they are not going to proceed to a final interview.</p>
<p>Telling people no is hard, but mistakenly bringing on the wrong people can be much worse. While you want to always be kind, and helpful to all applicants, your primary responsibility when hiring is to ensure that only the best people get hired. That is priority number one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a distributed company or someone who&#8217;s interested in working for one, there is plenty to learn from the post. I also encourage you to read this <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/04/the-ceo-of-automattic-on-holding-auditions-to-build-a-strong-team">Harvard Business Review article</a> from 2014 featuring Matt Mullenweg, on holding auditions to build a strong team.

<p>Nick Haskins launched <a href="https://story.am/" target="_blank">Story.am</a> earlier this year as a hosted storytelling platform that offers all the features of <a href="http://wptavern.com/?s=Aesop+Story+Engine" target="_blank">Aesop Story Engine</a>. Initially, the platform was only available to paying customers, but this week Haskins announced that Story.am is <a href="https://story.am/story-am-re-launch/" target="_blank">now available to everyone for free</a>.</p>
<p>The platform had not received much feedback in the several months it has been open to customers, so Haskins decided to remove all barriers to account creation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really want feedback on <a href="https://lasso.is/" target="_blank">Lasso</a>, our visual web editor on Story.AM,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By making it free, we hope to garner a lot of feedback, even if that feedback isn&#8217;t good. Often times, that type of feedback is the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>In our <a href="http://wptavern.com/introducing-lasso-a-new-frontend-editor-for-wordpress" target="_blank">recent review of Lasso</a>, Jeff Chandler found that the product wasn&#8217;t quite polished enough for prime time but that it has potential. Haskins is hoping to build a broader network of Lasso users who will offer the feedback he needs to improve the editing experience.</p>
<p>Immediately following his announcement that Story.am accounts are now available for free, Haskins was averaging one signup a minute.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>Newsletter out, story.am now averaging one signup a minute for the last few minutes. &#10;&#10;The power of free.</p>
<p>&mdash; Nick Haskins (@nphaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/nphaskins/status/591359988309708800">April 23, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Since the announcement yesterday evening there have been about 130 signups, so we&#8217;ve calmed down to about 5-7 signups an hour,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Story.am is a multisite installation that was built to be elastic and ready to scale. In the future, Haskins will open up a Pro level that will offer additional features such as the ability to sell story subscriptions with Stripe and use your own domain.</p>
<p>&#8220;The domain mapping and ability to sell story subscriptions are all in place and ready to go,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But rather than just releasing a Pro level straight away, I&#8217;m interested to see if what I THINK users want, is actually inline with what they REALLY want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haskins is taking notes of trends while monitoring the signups to get a better picture of how people plan to use Story.am.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m seeing a lot of what I would describe as &#8216;people who aren&#8217;t necessarily writers but want to tell stories,'&#8221; he said. &#8220;The domains that are coming across include terms like comic, pastor, fish, school, etc. It&#8217;s quite interesting to see. We are tracking everything in great detail, so as time goes on we&#8217;ll begin to have some solid metrics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many Story.am users are using the platform in the education space, a trend which has continued since opening up the site to free accounts. The platform is also open to bloggers, but Haskins is not aiming to compete with WordPress.com.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see folks use stories in their own unique ways, with their own flair, and I think this will be tough to come by on a &#8216;generalized&#8217; network. i.e, one that basically treats everyone as the same,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One thing I don&#8217;t want to purposefully do is compete with WordPress.com. I&#8217;d much rather work with them to bring our ideas and tools to their platform, in some way, shape, or form.&#8221;</p>
<p>Story.am has no current ETA for launching Pro level features, but Haskins said that he will be gauging the demand and gathering feedback before moving on monetizing the platform. If you&#8217;re curious about how Aesop Story Engine components work with WordPress and want to try the new Lasso frontend editor, it&#8217;s now as easy as signing up for a free account on <a href="https://story.am/">Story.am</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 22:18:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>One of the highlights of the recent <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-powell-is-now-available-for-download" target="_blank">WordPress 4.2</a> release is the <a href="http://wptavern.com/pressthis-revamped-with-a-new-user-interface-and-minimalist-design" target="_blank">completely revamped Press This interface</a>. The feature&#8217;s intended purpose is to make it easy to share text, images, and videos from around the web in a quick post, but many users are newly captivated by Press This&#8217; new minimalist design for post creation.</p>
<p>Once you try Press This for publishing, you may become some so partial to the posting form that you don&#8217;t want to go back to the standard post editor. It includes only the most essential formatting buttons and a button to add media, with all other extraneous selections for post formats, categories, and tags collapsed.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/press-this-new-post/" target="_blank">Press This New Post</a> is a new plugin, created by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/drewapicture/" target="_blank">Drew Jaynes</a>, that gives you quick access to the Press This posting form from the &#8216;+ New&#8217; drop-down in the toolbar.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/press-this-new-post.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[42776]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42787" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/press-this-new-post.jpg?resize=888%2C405" alt="press-this-new-post" /></a></p>
<p>The link takes you to the Press This editor where you can scan a URL or simply start writing a new post.</p>
<p>In the plugin&#8217;s description, Jaynes refers to the easy access as &#8220;Quick Draft on steroids,&#8221; but it may also become a real substitute for WordPress&#8217; dearly-departed <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-zen-mode-5-compelling-reasons-to-turn-on-distraction-free-writing" target="_blank">zen mode</a>. Many users are distracted by the sliding side menu and the fading of non-essential parts of the editor that was introduced in WordPress 4.1 when the <a href="http://wptavern.com/focus-project-and-session-ui-approved-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-1" target="_blank">Focus Project was merged into core</a>. These animations are guaranteed not to happen to you in Press This mode.</p>

<p>Jaynes is a regular user of the Press This post editor, which was one of his motivations for creating the quick access plugin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already drafted three blog posts using it instead of the standard editor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Obviously in most cases I finish up in the standard editor, but I really like the posting interface.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if we get to the point where Press This supports other post types and/or even other sites in a multisite network, it could really save a lot of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Press This team is actively working on continuing to iterate the feature along those lines and both <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelarestad" target="_blank">Michael Arestad</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stephdau" target="_blank">Stephane Daury</a> have stepped up as core component maintainers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know for a fact that they both have future plans for improving and iterating it,&#8221; Jaynes said. &#8220;It’s actually really cool to see a continuation of the passion beyond a feature plugin getting merged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michael Arestad recently posted his thoughts on <a href="http://blog.michaelarestad.com/2015/04/23/pressed-it/" target="_blank">the future of Press This</a> and listed a host of features that the team is looking at adding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split button (gonna be awesome)</li>
<li>Some rearranging of components</li>
<li>Improved tags UI</li>
<li>Featured image</li>
<li>Browser extensions</li>
<li>Site switching</li>
<li>Image flow improvements are in the works, which should drastically improve the media experience in both editors</li>
<li>Improved NUX flow</li>
</ul>
<p>With its committed maintainers, the Press This feature is well-positioned to evolve to support more diverse content types, which may attract even more users than the bookmarklet does in the long run. If you&#8217;re still thinking of Press This as just a simple bookmarklet for re-posting content, you may want to revisit it. The feature has the potential to influence future iterations of the standard post editor, which suddenly seems a little cluttered.</p>

She&#8217;s used WordPress for more than 10 years and has knowledge of the developing tech scene in Jamaica. In this interview, we learn how she discovered WordPress, the Jamaican WordPress community, and if the country will ever host a WordCamp.</p>
<p><strong>How long have you used WordPress?</strong></p>
<p>I just celebrated my 10th anniversary. I started using WordPress in 2005 and my first post was on April 2nd, 2005.</p>
<p><strong>What is your WordPress origin story?</strong></p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WPProfileOriginStory.png" rel="prettyphoto[42752]"><img class="size-full wp-image-42763" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WPProfileOriginStory.png?resize=736%2C227" alt="As seen on the WordPress profile page" /></a>As seen on the WordPress profile page
<p>I was working at IBM at the time and finally decided I liked the idea of having my own <a href="http://biancawelds.com/">personal website</a>. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I wanted to have a blog as well as a static site. I knew I could build an HTML site myself, so I researched this blogging thing, and I found <a href="https://www.blogger.com/home">Blogspot</a>. Within a day of signing up, I became frustrated at not being able to customize it, so I looked for alternatives. I came across WordPress and fell in love, purchased a hosting account, installed it, and never looked back.</p>
<p><strong>What is the tech scene like in Jamaica?</strong></p>
<p>The tech scene is currently developing nicely. There has been a lot of slow foundation growth over the last decade, but in the last few years, we have seen some dramatic acceleration. The tech meetup, <a href="http://kingstonbeta.com/">Kingston Beta</a>, grew to hosting a regional conference called <a href="http://connectimass.com/media-2/community-events/connect-events-networks/caribbean-beta/">Caribbean Beta</a>.</p>
<p>The Slash Roots Developer Community saw the formation of the <a href="http://slashroots.org/">Slash Roots Foundation</a> which does a lot of work in the Open Data space. It expanded to organize the <a href="http://developingcaribbean.org/">Developing the Caribbean</a> conference, and was instrumental in the formation of <a href="http://codeforthecaribbean.org/">Code for the Caribbean</a>.</p>
<p>Startup events have been growing with our first Startup Weekend taking place in 2013. The Digital Jam Mobile Application competition was held for three years along with several other initiatives. The first <a href="http://venturecapitaljamaica.com/conference/about">Venture Capital Conference</a> was held in 2013 where the first formal angel investor group, <a href="http://www.firstangelsja.com/">First Angels</a>, was created. <a href="http://www.start-upjamaica.com/en/p/list/57094">StartUpJamaica</a> is our first accelerator and it launched last year with over 200 applications, where 36 teams participated in boot camps and training. This is a small sample of the things that are happening in our space.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a vibrant WordPress community in Jamaica?</strong></p>
<p>Vibrant on an individual level perhaps. There is no active WordPress community at present. There are a lot of WordPress sites being built and a lot of WordPress blogs being run, but they are more or less individual efforts with no real communication or collaboration to grow and develop a community.</p>
<p>I have recently started putting out feelers to see if there is enough interest in starting a regular WordPress meetup. In the last week, I&#8217;ve had interest from about two dozen people.</p>
<p><strong>To date, there has not been a WordCamp in Jamaica. Do you think there will ever be one and will you help organize it?</strong></p>
<p>I hope there will be and I definitely want to be a part of it. The first goal though would be to get the meetups going and gather a core community, so that&#8217;s my focus now.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever attended a WordCamp? If not, which one will be your first?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have never attended any WordCamps. I am working on changing that in the near future by going to <a href="http://miami.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp Miami</a> which is the nearest one to Jamaica.</p>

<p><strong>What do you like most about WordPress and what do you like the least?</strong></p>
<p>My favorite thing about WordPress is its flexibility. While it may not be the perfect solution for every challenge, there are few things that cannot be done. My least favorite thing is how much there is to learn to truly take full advantage of its power.</p>
<p><strong>If you wanted people to know something about Jamaica, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>The one thing I always try to share when I am <strong>the Jamaican</strong> in the crowd is that, Jamaica is so much more than beaches, weed and reggae. It definitely has those, but there are so many other aspects to our geography, our culture and our people who outsiders don&#8217;t yet fully grasp. But the world is learning.</p>

There&#8217;s no information about the release on the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32051">Make WordPress Core</a> site or the official <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/">WordPress news blog</a>. However, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.1.3">this Codex article</a> explains what&#8217;s in 4.1.3 and the reason it was released.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fix database writes for esoteric character sets, broken in the WordPress 4.1.2 security release. Neither UTF-8 nor latin1 were affected. For more information, see <a class="external text" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32051">ticket #32051</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ticket contains a lengthy technical discussion of a critical bug and what was done to fix it. In addition to 4.1.3, the patch was merged into the following versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>3.7.7</li>
<li>3.8.7</li>
<li>3.9.5</li>
<li>4.0.3</li>
</ul>
<p>Since these are point releases, sites running WordPress 3.7 and higher will automatically update unless the server doesn&#8217;t support it or they&#8217;re disabled. If you&#8217;re running an old version of WordPress, I highly encourage you to update to 4.2. Not only does it have <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-powell-is-now-available-for-download">some nifty new features</a>, but it also fixes <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=closed&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&type=defect+%28bug%29&version=%21&version=%21trunk&resolution=fixed&milestone=4.2&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=type&col=owner&col=priority&order=priority" target="_blank">231 defects</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 04:25:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<h3>The consistency of WordPress</h3>
<p>WordPress 4.2,&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/powell/">Powell</a>,&nbsp;marks the impressive sixth major version in a row on a four month average development cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress 3.7: October 24th, 2013</li>
<li>WordPress 3.8: December 12th, 2013</li>
<li>WordPress 3.9: April 16th, 2014</li>
<li>WordPress 4.0: September 4th, 2014</li>
<li>WordPress 4.1: December 18th, 2014</li>
<li>WordPress 4.2: April 23rd, 2015</li>
</ul>
<p>This streak of consistency in WordPress releases is not accidental. Groundwork was put in place organizationally, technically, and philosophically to help ensure consistent, iterative improvements for WordPress.</p>
<p>The project has always been quite good at updates, if compared to competition. However, a few releases prior to 3.7 got sidetracked, distracted, or thrown off schedule if held to our own high standard.</p>
<p>Concepts such as the introduction of <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/">feature plugins</a> have helped put sanity and routine into the release schedule, even without repeat release leads these last six versions (and none will repeat at least through 4.4).</p>
<h4>Features of WordPress 4.2</h4>
<h3>Press This</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12436" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/press-this-wp-752x517.png" alt="press-this-wp" width="752" height="517" /></p>
<p>It’s quite possible even long term WordPress users have never heard of, much less used, Press This. However, the bookmarklet makes sharing and publishing others’ articles on your own blog quite simple.</p>
<p>It was long overdue to either be cut from core or completely revamped. It was completely revamped under the “feature as plugin” model, led by Michael Arestad.</p>
<p>I’ve been using the new Press This or a while now on my personal blog, and it’s really great. If your goal is to blog more regularly, and you like to curate or share what you’re reading/watching, you’ll love Press This. You can find the bookmarklet in the admin and primary Tools page.</p>
<p>The editor is modern and honestly a great prototype for what could be a future full WordPress editor. The bookmarklet sits in my bookmarks, and it’s encouraged me to more often blog my thoughts on what I read — versus leave my thoughts with a single Tweet.</p>
<p>I was at first on the fence as to whether Press This made sense to get a revamp. I’m now convinced it was a great decision, and the team that worked on most of the features was outstanding.</p>
<p>There are more features coming to Press This. You can check some of them out <a href="http://blog.michaelarestad.com/2015/04/23/pressed-it/">on Michael’s blog post</a> celebrating its inclusion in 4.2. If you’ve never pressed anything with Press This, definitely give it a shot.</p>
<h3>Customizer Theme Switcher</h3>
<p>Another feature plugin that made it into 4.2 is the Customizer Theme Switcher. Relatively self-explanatory, this feature brings the theme choosing experience to the customizer.</p>
<p>The project was lead by Nick Halsey, and you can find the core proposal for the feature <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/11/customizer-theme-switcher-feature-plugin-merge-proposal/">on the Make WordPress blog</a>. Not many folks using WordPress as a full CMS will change themes that often, but for those that do, the move for selecting and testing themes to the customizer makes sense.</p>
<h3>Shiny Updates</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12438" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shiny-updates.png" alt="shiny-updates" width="707" height="391" /></p>
<p>Shiny Updates allows for inline updates directly in the plugins admin screen, without a redirect to the funky plugin update progression page you’re probably quite familiar with.</p>
<p>Shiny Updates is part of a larger effort for making both updates and installs better. Due to some potential UX issues and in order to stick with the release schedule, shiny installs was postponed. However, in a future release, the install and activation process for plugins will be a simpler process as well.</p>
<h3>Utf8mb4 support to enable special characters and emoji</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12437" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/4.2-characters-752x626.png" alt="4.2-characters" width="752" height="626" /></p>
<p>WordPress can now handle all sorts of special characters by default, including Chinese, but also various glyphs and other symbols. And yes, emoji.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most discussed and also misunderstood feature of WordPress 4.2, Utf8mb4 makes WordPress more accessible in more languages, and that is awesome.</p>
<p>Also, don’t kid yourself: everyone loves emoji. As WordPress is used more as a mobile app backend, this change will be especially welcome. Can you imagine an app that didn’t support emoji? Of course not. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>By the way, there is <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Emoji">a handy Codex article</a> that details how to enable the emoji keyboard on various operating systems.</p>
<h3>Notes on developer features</h3>
<p>There are some great developer features in WordPress 4.2 as well. I highly recommend reading Aaron Jorbin&#8217;s <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/04/23/wordpress-4-2-field-notes/">field notes post</a> that details some of the key features for developers and also has links to detailed posts to cover each one.</p>
<h3>An excellent release</h3>
<p>WordPress 4.2 is an excellent release that has a nice balance of new features, fixes, and developer enhancements.</p>

<p><code>$response = wp_remote_get($url, array(<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;'User-Agent' => 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0'<br />

<p>Thankfully, <a href="http://ottopress.com">Otto</a> spotted my problem. The `user-agent` key needs to be lowercase so that it is picked up properly by the WordPress core code. This works:</p>
<p><code>$response = wp_remote_get($url, array(<br />

This release expands the capabilities of Jetpack&#8217;s centralized site management to include menus. If you have <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/site-management/" target="_blank">Jetpack Manage</a> activated, you can now log into WordPress.com to manage menus for any of your sites that have opted in.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/menu-management.png" rel="prettyphoto[42711]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/menu-management.png?resize=700%2C404" alt="menu-management" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42721" /></a></p>
<p>The benefit of going to WordPress.com to manage menus for self-hosted sites was not immediately evident for those who don&#8217;t make use of the centralized site management feature. The interface is different and the dashboard contains a limited set of site management controls.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/pollyplummer">@pollyplummer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jetpack">@jetpack</a> I can’t think of any. Aside from how weird that is, the disconnect isn’t intuitive. Solutions in search of problems.</p>
<p>&mdash; John Parris (@John_Parris) <a href="https://twitter.com/John_Parris/status/591370442839056384">April 23, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>For those who manage just one or two sites, it isn&#8217;t clear why you would opt to log into WordPress.com instead of your site&#8217;s admin panel, which is essentially the command center, where everything is at your disposal.</p>
<p>Jetpack representative Jeremy Herve <a href="https://twitter.com/jeherve/status/591342288867106816" target="_blank">explained</a> that the primary benefits of the menu management feature are applicable &#8220;when working on multiple sites, when on mobile, and when you don&#8217;t want to log into the self-hosted site.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must also admit than I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of the Menus interface in WordPress.org,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s confusing for new users.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you prefer WordPress.com&#8217;s menu manager and posting interface but want to retain the freedom of self-hosting your site, then Jetpack Manage may be a good fit for you. If the disconnected, dissimilar interfaces don&#8217;t make sense for managing your sites, then there&#8217;s no need to activate it. Currently, bulk plugin management across multiple sites seems to be the most popular use of Jetpack Manage.</p>

It is named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Powell" target="_blank">Earl Rudolph &#8220;Bud&#8221; Powell</a>, an American jazz pianist. This release, <a href="http://wptavern.com/drew-jaynes-to-lead-wordpress-4-2" target="_blank">led by 10up engineer Drew Jaynes</a>, offers a balanced mix of front-facing features that users will enjoy, as well as improvements for developers. Here is a tour of the highlights.</p>
<h3>Press This Overhauled</h3>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/press-this-new.png" rel="prettyphoto[42641]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/press-this-new.png?resize=986%2C531" alt="press-this-new" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42649" /></a></p>
<p>WordPress 4.2 contributors have brought the Press This feature back to life with a <a href="http://wptavern.com/pressthis-revamped-with-a-new-user-interface-and-minimalist-design" target="_blank">completely revamped interface</a> that makes it easy to share content from any website. It allows you to grab text, images, and videos, quickly add your thoughts, and publish. Any media is automatically added to your media library during the process. Add the bookmarklet from the Tools screen to your browser&#8217;s bookmark bar or your mobile desktop to jump start your publishing.</p>
<h3>Switch Themes in the Customizer</h3>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/customizer-theme-switcher.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[42641]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/customizer-theme-switcher.jpg?resize=1025%2C473" alt="customizer-theme-switcher" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38931" /></a></p>
<p>WordPress 4.2 makes it possible to <a href="http://wptavern.com/customizer-theme-switcher-approved-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-2" target="_blank">switch themes in the customizer</a>.  Users can now browse through themes that have already been installed and activate a new one without ever leaving the frontend. This further streamlines the UI for customizing your site and paves the way for the theme installation process to be added to the customizer in the future.</p>
<h3>Expanded 4-Byte Unicode Character Support, Including Emoji</h3>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/emoji-support.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[42641]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/emoji-support.jpg?resize=1025%2C512" alt="emoji-support" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42652" /></a></p>
<p>This release changes database character encoding from  utf8mb3 to utf8mb4, which makes it possible for WordPress to <a href="http://wptavern.com/emoji-enables-wordpress-to-natively-support-chinese-korean-and-japanese-characters" target="_blank">natively support Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters</a>. The character encoding update also opens up a whole new world for using musical and mathematical symbols, hieroglyphs, and <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Emoji" target="_blank">emoji</a>. Emoji support has been added everywhere, and you can even <a href="http://www.brandonkraft.com/b/2015/03/emoji-wordpress-and-you/" target="_blank">use them in URLs</a>, if you&#8217;re adventurous.</p>
<h3>Enhanced Plugin Updates</h3>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/new-plugin-updates.png" rel="prettyphoto[42641]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/new-plugin-updates.png?resize=657%2C325" alt="new-plugin-updates" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42658" /></a></p>
<p>After you update to 4.2, you will be able to update plugins on the plugins screen without refreshing the page and without being whisked away to a new update screen. This makes it a more intuitive process and cuts down on the clicking required to manage your site in the admin. It is also the first stepping stone toward <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-radically-improves-the-plugin-install-and-update-process" target="_blank">improving the plugin installation process</a> to provide the same convenient experience.</p>
<h3>Improvements Under the Hood</h3>
<p>In addition to all the front-facing improvements, WordPress 4.2 includes some equally exciting updates for developers.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-detects-shared-terms-in-wordpress-ahead-of-taxonomy-term-splitting-in-4-2" target="_blank">Taxonomy Term Splitting</a> &#8211; terms shared across multiple taxonomies will now be split when one of them is updated.</li>
<li>Complex Query Ordering &#8211; <code>WP_Query</code>, <code>WP_Comment_Query</code>, and <code>WP_User_Query</code> now support complex ordering with named meta query clauses.</li>
<li>JavaScript Accessibility &#8211; Send audible notifications to screen readers in JavaScript with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2015/04/15/let-wordpress-speak-new-in-wordpress-4-2/" target="_blank">wp.a11y.speak()</a>. Pass it a string, and an update will be sent to a dedicated ARIA live notifications area.</li>
<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/04/23/tinymce-views-api-improvements/" target="_blank">TinyMCE views API improvements</a> &#8211; this API is not yet ready for production but developers are welcome to test and experiment with it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Many More Small Improvements</h3>
<p>WordPress 4.2 is also packed full of subtle refinements that make it more beautiful and easier to use. The <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-introduces-subtle-refinements-to-the-default-admin-color-scheme" target="_blank">default admin color scheme has been updated</a> every so slightly to be more harmonious to the eyes and more consistent with WordPress&#8217; branding.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-will-automatically-enable-pretty-permalinks-for-new-sites-on-installation" target="_blank">Pretty permalinks are now automatically enabled</a> for new sites on installation. In most cases, administrators on new sites will never be greeted with ugly permalinks again, saving a step in the setup process.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds" target="_blank">oEmbed white list</a> has been updated to include Tumblr.com and Kickstarter, so you can easily paste links into the post editor and have the content instantly appear.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2 fixes <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=closed&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&type=defect+(bug)&version=!&version=!trunk&resolution=fixed&milestone=4.2&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=type&col=owner&col=priority&order=priority" target="_blank">231 defects</a>, thanks to the volunteer efforts of 283 contributors. A complete list of all the changes in this release is available in the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2" target="_blank">4.2 codex page</a>. For a quick tour of all the highlights in 4.2, check out the video created for this release:</p>

<p>The punk Wapuu was <a href="http://wptavern.com/scott-evans-on-designing-the-punk-wapuu-for-wordcamp-london-2015" target="_blank">created for WordCamp London 2015</a> by Scott Evans with collaboration from the event&#8217;s organizing team. The mascot was so well-received that Evans&#8217; colleagues urged him to see if it could land in the swag store.</p>
<p>&#8220;I supplied the vector artwork and some guidance and passed it on to Hello Merch which did the rest,&#8221; he said. Within approximately three weeks the t-shirt was made available for sale.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unusual to see new items added to the WordPress Swag Store, but the iconic Wapuunk mascot seems to be an instant hit with swag collectors.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all the buzz of WordCamp London it seemed worth a go,&#8221; Evans said. &#8220;After all, they are different from the official WordCamp t-shirts we made. I think lots of folk were keen to see Wapuunk on a t-shirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast to the simple WordPress logo-branded items, Wapuunk and other variations of the mascot have a unique way of linking the local culture and/or an event experience with the logo. Wapuu variations illustrate the variety of WordPress communities around the globe. They evoke a strong connection between the software and the local community.</p>

<p>The WordPress Theme Review team made a major decision this week to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/04/21/this-weeks-meeting-important-information-regarding-theme-options/" target="_blank">enforce the use of the native customizer</a> on new themes submitted to the directory. Theme authors who want to include customization options will no longer be able to create their own settings panels but will be required to follow the new customizer standard, effective immediately.</p>
<p>Existing themes in the directory will have six months to comply before the Theme Review Team starts to enforce the new requirement. To facilitate this process the team is preparing a series of posts and better documentation on how to use the customizer.</p>
<p>Theme Review Team member Justin Tadlock <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1429641246005571" target="_blank">brought the matter to a vote</a> during the last meeting:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m proposing that we do an outright ban on custom settings screens in the admin. The plan was to allow theme authors to naturally move over to the customizer given time. This hasn&#8217;t worked.</p></blockquote>
<p>As attempts to standardize the use of the customizer in new themes have not been successful, the Theme Review Team has opted to draw a hard line, as gatekeepers to the official directory. For the most part, reactions to the new guidelines have been positive, but theme authors who incorporate other options frameworks are not thrilled about having to rewrite their options for the customizer.</p>
<h3>Will the Customizer Requirement Stifle Innovation for Theme Developers?</h3>
<p>While many developers agree that the customizer is WordPress&#8217; strongest option right now for providing live previews on design customizations, some are worried that the new requirement will limit creativity and innovation that might spring up from different solutions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/justintadlock">@justintadlock</a> Big change.  I'm pro customizer but not allowing it means better solutions may not see the light of day or even be attempted.</p>

<p></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/justintadlock">@justintadlock</a> It's better than most as far as WP goes today. I'd just hate to see it stifle other ways of tackling the customizer concept.</p>
<p>&mdash; Carl Hancock (@carlhancock) <a href="https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/590614883525341185">April 21, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/simplerain" target="_blank">Dovy Paukstys</a>, lead developer of the Redux Framework, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/04/21/this-weeks-meeting-important-information-regarding-theme-options/#comment-41129" target="_blank">commented</a> on the announcement to express a common concern among developers who utilize more specialized controls than the customizer can currently provide.</p>
<blockquote><p>So essentially what you’re mandating is for Frameworks, like Redux, to port all of their special controls to the Customizer because if a theme uses any form of a custom control and doesn&#8217;t display it in the customizer, in 6 months time you will boot from WP.org. Correct?</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t that seem a little narrow sighted? The customizer is great for live reload, but it doesn&#8217;t have the real-estate for advanced fields that developers make.</p></blockquote>
<p>Resistance to the new guideline is frequently met with the suggestion that developers instead work on improving the customizer to be better for all users, as it is now WordPress&#8217; core-supported method of providing theme options. Paukstys finds it to be too limited in its current state for anything other than simple style changes.</p>
<blockquote><p>My personal motivation to improve the customizer is low since I personally do not see it as a viable option outside of styling. There’s simply not enough real-estate from a design perspective. It also doesn’t have things like visual validation, warnings, etc. It doesn’t offer field visibility linking, etc. It serves a powerful purpose, but I do not feel it is a complete replacement for the settings API.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paukstys further contends that the community was not represented in the decision process that followed the official proposal and that the new mandate unfairly promotes a single, narrow approach.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why do you wish to limit developers so much? Isn’t the point of open source for people to make things in different ways and improve the whole? Why are you limiting your devs? Could it be that the customizer hasn&#8217;t had the adoption that you think it deserves? This just seems like a mandate by your team and not a desire of the community as a whole.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Emil Uzelac, theme authors using Redux or another framework are still at liberty to use the <a href="http://tgmpluginactivation.com/" target="_blank">TGM Plugin Activation library</a> to notify users of a theme being “Redux-Ready,&#8221; for example, but will not be able to fully package those options as part of the theme submitted to WordPress.org.</p>
<p>Tadlock is currently preparing a more comprehensive reply to these concerns but maintains that he will always support more innovative ways of approaching customization, should a new solution surpass that of the customizer in the future.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/carlhancock">@carlhancock</a> I'll always fight to get something innovative pushed through even if it doesn't fit in the guidelines.</p>
<p>&mdash; Justin Tadlock (@justintadlock) <a href="https://twitter.com/justintadlock/status/590616882648109056">April 21, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The Theme Review guidelines have continued to evolve with WordPress over the years and the team meetings are open to all who wish to have a voice in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Tadlock is aiming to produce more education for theme authors within a day or two. He has also committed to helping developers build controls that are not readily available.</p>
<blockquote><p>Make me a list of controls you’d like to see. Core added a lot more options in 4.0, but I’m open to building any control classes that could be utilized by theme authors. If there’s a control that the customizer doesn’t support out of the box, it should be built by extending the core <code>WP_Customize_Control</code> class. I’ll at least attempt to build any controls that people need help with.</p></blockquote>
<p>Theme developers who are worried about working with a limited set of customizer options will have help from the Theme Review Team. Those with themes that need updating have a six-month head start before the guidelines will be enforced on themes that submit an update.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 21:00:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The new requirement will be phased in over 6 months, which gives existing theme authors some time to make the updates and new theme authors some time to adjust themes that might already be in progress.</p>
<p>This is a huge change. Although the Customizer has been available since WordPress 3.4 &#8212; which was released in June of 2012 &#8212; adoption has been slow on themes submitted to the official WordPress theme repository.</p>
<p>Official stats aren&#8217;t available, but of the <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?priority=new+theme&status=new&priority=previously+reviewed&keywords=!~buddypress&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=time&col=changetime&col=reporter&report=2&order=time">ten most recent themes</a> submitted to the theme repo I looked at, 20% had a custom options page. Of the <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?priority=theme+update&status=new&status=reopened&keywords=!~buddypress&col=id&col=summary&col=priority&col=status&col=reporter&col=owner&col=time&col=changetime&report=1&order=time">ten most recent updates</a>, 40% had a custom options page. This is a very small sample, but there&#8217;s no doubt this change will effect a huge amount of submissions.</p>
<p>From a theme review perspective this makes a lot of sense. Verifying proper sanitization and proper use of the Settings API can take a huge amount of time for reviewers.</p>
<p>Many theme authors use frameworks like the Options Framework, Redux, Titan, Options Tree, and UpThemes &#8212; but reviewers still need to check for potentially malicious alterations, proper text domains, and function prefixing. Standardizing this by requiring the Customizer will make the job of theme review simpler.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/devinsays">@devinsays</a> Echoing others, it's a win for users and will speed up review times. I think the time has come.</p>

<p></p>
<p>From a user interface perspective, it also seems like a good move. Users can always expect options to be available in the Customizer tab if they exist and they won&#8217;t need to navigate unfamiliar custom screen layouts &#8212; though users of specific themes might be confused when the options page disappears on an update and moves into the Customizer bar.</p>
<p>For theme authors it is probably a mixed bag. Many authors rely on WordPress.org to drive sales of commercial theme upsells, and the theme options page is a common place to promote such upsells. It can also take quite a bit of time to migrate options from a custom page to the Customizer and ensure perfect backwards compatibility.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/devinsays">@devinsays</a> I think it’s a great way to standardize and will ultimately be easier for both users and theme authors.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Certain frameworks also provide features that aren&#8217;t native to the Customizer, like repeater fields, multiselect, image radio buttons, datepickers, editor instances, and custom typography options &#8212; though Customizer libraries like <a href="http://kirki.org/">Kirki</a> can also bridge those gaps.</p>
<p>The Customizer has evolved quite a bit since it was first introduced. WordPress 4.0 brought a number of enhancements like contextual controls, panels and additional field types. Core features like custom headers, custom backgrounds and widget editing have migrated to the Customizer and then been improved over successive releases. In the upcoming WordPress 4.2 release users will be able to switch themes directly from the Customizer.</p>
<p>It could be argued that space constraints in the Customizer could make organization a bit more difficult for themes that ship with hundreds of different options, but there are many examples of WordPress themes already handling this well.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/make/">Make theme</a> by the Theme Foundry is one such example. It has six custom panels and over three hundred individual customization options &#8212; but is still a very usable and popular product. Obox <a title="Layers, by Obox, introduces a beautiful page building interface" href="https://poststatus.com/layers-theme-obox/">also went all in</a> on the Customizer with their Layers page builder theme. Examples like these help prove that the Customizer can scale fairly well, even with a lot of options.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the standardization of options is a great move forward. I originally started developing the <a href="http://wptheming.com/options-framework-theme/">Options Framework</a> (an easy way for developers to build custom options pages) over five years ago because there was not a good solution in core. I&#8217;m now happy to report that the code I helped develop is nearly obsolete as better tools have become available.</p>

Sellers should review their code and <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/04/20/fixing-add_query_arg-and-remove_query_arg-usage/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/04/20/fixing-add_query_arg-and-remove_query_arg-usage/">follow the guidelines</a> published on the Make WordPress plugins site.</p>
<p>While auditing the TGM Plugin Activation class, a XSS vulnerability was discovered. The TGM Plugin Activation class has since been updated despite the version number not being changed. If you&#8217;re a seller and use this class, you&#8217;ll need to update to the latest version of TGM Plugin Activation and update your item to include the latest version.</p>
<h2>OptionTree</h2>
<p>If you use <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/option-tree/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/option-tree/">OptionTree</a>, the marketplace review team is confident that all instances of <strong>add_query_arg</strong> and <strong>remove_query_arg</strong> have been escaped properly. There will be an update in the future that escapes these functions you should include in your item, but you shouldn&#8217;t delay updating your items while waiting for the update.</p>
<h2>Redux Framework</h2>
<p>The <a title="http://reduxframework.com/" href="http://reduxframework.com/">Redux framework</a> also uses <strong>add_query_arg</strong> and <strong>remove_query_arg</strong>, but most are escaped appropriately. There are a few questionable areas within the theme that the review team will provide updates on once they receive clarification.</p>
<h2>Theme Authors</h2>
<p>Theme authors who have bundled affected third-party plugins will be contacted by Envato in the next few days to update your theme. You&#8217;re encouraged to check bundled plugins before this time to see if they&#8217;re affected.</p>
<h2>Buyers</h2>
<p>According to Cronin, all WordPress specific items are being evaluated. Once the evaluation is complete, buyers who purchased an affected item will be notified. There&#8217;s no time frame on when the evaluation will be completed, however, Cronin says it is a priority and progress reports will be published in this <a title="http://codecanyon.net/forums/thread/security-vulnerability-affecting-wordpress-plugins-and-themes/173013" href="http://codecanyon.net/forums/thread/security-vulnerability-affecting-wordpress-plugins-and-themes/173013">forum thread</a>.</p>
<h2>All Hands on Deck</h2>
<p>Cronin says, &#8220;When submitting an update that addresses these issues, please include a note mentioning it&#8217;s related to the <a title="http://wptavern.com/xss-vulnerability-affects-more-than-a-dozen-popular-wordpress-plugins" href="http://wptavern.com/xss-vulnerability-affects-more-than-a-dozen-popular-wordpress-plugins">XSS vulnerability</a>. This will allow us to prioritize the review of updates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike the WordPress.org plugin directory, Themeforest and CodeCanyon only provide and notify buyers of updates if they register with the update system. It&#8217;s not an optimal upgrade routine and one that requires buyers to opt-in instead of opt-out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that sellers on Envato&#8217;s marketplaces do their part to check and patch any XSS vulnerabilities discovered. It&#8217;s also important the lines of communication remain open between the marketplaces and buyers so they can update purchased items as soon as possible. If you do business with Themeforest or CodeCanyon, be on the lookout for updates to items you&#8217;ve purchased.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 20:42:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>The official <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook/" target="_blank">Facebook plugin for WordPress</a> launched in 2012 with the help of engineers from Automattic and currently lists 14 contributing authors. The plugin is active on more than 200,000 websites, but Facebook has not updated the plugin description page to let users know that it has been <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordpress-is-not-your-enemy-facebook-so-update-and-support-your-plugin" target="_blank">abandoned</a>.</p>
<p>The Facebook plugin has received no updates since March 2014, and support questions have gone unanswered for approximately a year. The plugin&#8217;s star ratings have plummeted to 2.2 out of 5.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/facebook-plugin-forums.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[42519]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/facebook-plugin-forums.jpg?resize=775%2C409" alt="facebook-plugin-forums" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42551" /></a></p>
<p>The official word on the plugin is that Facebook has abandoned it and it is now <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/wordpress" target="_blank">supported by the community</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Facebook for WordPress was an officially supported tool to help WordPress developers integrate Social Plugins and publish Open Graph stories.</p>
<p>The plugin is no longer officially supported by Facebook but is maintained by the developer community.</p></blockquote>
<p>WordPress.com VIP still uses the plugin and has it listed among its <a href="https://vip.wordpress.com/plugins/" target="_blank">plugins and partners</a> but has developed a version tailored to VIP customers. If the plugin is similar enough to the official one listed on WordPress.org, it would be helpful to have some of the changes ported back to the community version.</p>
<p>I spoke with Sara Rosso from the VIP team to inquire about Automattic&#8217;s plans for the Facebook plugin. Automattic&#8217;s official response indicates that they will not be part of the community support effort:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re currently supporting the Facebook plugin for use on the WordPress.com VIP platform, and we&#8217;ve made some modifications to it to work with our infrastructure. Automattic was a contributor to the initial version of the plugin (we provided some consultation and support), but there aren&#8217;t any plans to officially adopt ongoing development of the plugin as of today.</p></blockquote>
<p>The plugin provides a complex assortment of features that utilize Facebook&#8217;s ever-changing APIs. As such, it&#8217;s not easy to support and requires regular updates to keep it current with changes at Facebook. The one-year old version is now riddled with bugs.</p>
<p>Until a new maintainer steps up to adopt the plugin, WordPress users have no choice but to use <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=facebook" target="_blank">alternative community plugins</a>, which are linked on the documentation for the official plugin on Facebook.com.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 20:00:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

I was going to write a review, and still will, but ended up writing a bunch on the process of buying things from Apple as a loyal customer.</p>
<p>I have done the second-market Craigslist dance with probably 90% of new Apple tablets and phones before, but never for a laptop. I&#8217;m sure every ounce of effort has been expended to capitalize on the hype of the announcements and ship as many of these as possible, but this Macbook/Watch roll-out still seems especially rough with the stores having zero inventory or knowledge of if/when they&#8217;re getting anything in, and ship dates now slipping into the summer. There&#8217;s a deeper issue though: it speaks to a lack of Apple&#8217;s knowledge and connection to their customers, even though they have all the data.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://elevenmadisonpark.com/">great restaurant</a> will <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Setting-Table-Transforming-Hospitality-Business/dp/0060742763">track every time you&#8217;ve eaten there, how much you spent, your preferences</a>, and use that to prioritize reservations and tailor service on subsequent visits. Airlines, for their terrible reputation, actually are decent at this too with their loyalty programs. On United I&#8217;m a <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323423804579025120455867410">Global Services level flyer</a> and get some really nice perks as a result, with the knowledge that if I don&#8217;t fly a certain amount of miles and spend a certain amount of dollars with them in a calendar year I&#8217;ll lose those perks (as I did for a few months earlier this year) and so when choosing between two flights to somewhere I&#8217;m more likely to pick the United one. (Also I think <em>some</em> of airlines bad rep is undeserved, they are flying human beings miles in the air inside tin cans where the cost of an error is catastrophic, everything is highly regulated, and many service factors are literally dependent on the weather.)</p>
<p>I am an unapologetic, unrepentant Apple customer ever since I could afford it. One of the first things I did when I got my job at CNET in 2005 was upgrade my Mom from the inexpensive Linux box I built for her (all I could afford) to a Mac Mini. I get almost every new version of everything, including usually 4-6 phones a year (myself and family), at least a dozen laptops, iPads, Thunderbolt displays, iMacs, Mac Pros&#8230; at this point I&#8217;m probably a cumulative $100k customer of Apple, in addition to the millions we spend on Apple hardware at <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> (everyone gets a new computer when they join, and we refresh them every 18-24 months, and <a href="https://matt.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/new-laptop-sticker/">a special W version at after 4 years of tenure</a>). And I&#8217;m late to the game! There are Apple customers today who bought their first product <em>decades</em> ago.</p>
<p>However when pre-orders creak open at midnight, or people start queueing, the order of access to the latest and greatest from Apple is by whoever shows up first, or now online it&#8217;s essentially random depending on how lucky you are to load and complete the checkout process. In some ways there&#8217;s a beautiful equality to that, but for example when I went <a href="https://matt.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/huge-line-at-the-samsung-store-this-morning/">with Om in London for the 2013 iPhone release</a>, 95% of the line was people just there to buy and flip it, either locally or ship overseas &#8212; the very front of the line was Apple lovers, but in the rest of the line I saw people using Android.</p>
<p>There is some sort of rank ordering inside Apple &#8212; <a href="http://9to5mac.com/community/karl-lagerfeld-has-an-apple-watch-w-gold-link-bracelet/">Karl Lagerfied</a> and <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/04/20/beyonce-exclusive-apple-watch-gold-link-bracelet/">Beyonce have Apple Watches</a> already, reviewers from <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Gruber</a> to <a href="http://davidpogue.com/">Pogue</a> get devices a few weeks early to test &#8212; <strong>but imagine if there was an Apple Loyalty program for the rest of us?</strong> More than almost any other company Apple has been sustained through tough times by the belief and devotion of their best customers. It would be great if you could earn status with monetary (dollars spent) and non-monetary (impact on the world) points that give you priority ordering access, faster Genius bar appointments, maybe even access to events.</p>
<p>Maybe the truth is Apple doesn&#8217;t need to do that, I&#8217;m going to keep using them because they make the best products, and when things are rough in the early days (like with the new Macbook, a few recent versions of OS X and iOS) I stick it out because I know it&#8217;ll get better. To my knowledge no other tech product maker has done a great loyalty program before, though there are hints in Asian players like <a href="http://www.mi.com/en/">Xiaomi</a> and <a href="https://oneplus.net/">OnePlus</a>. Most luxury brands from <a href="http://www.hermes.com/">Hermes</a> to <a href="https://www.patek.com/en/home">Patek</a> are also bad at this, because they don&#8217;t understand technology and data. But how cool would it be if Apple did reward, or even just recognize, their most loyal customers?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 17:55:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:10:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Tue, 05 May 2015 11:27:47 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"205709";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Tue, 05 May 2015 11:15:16 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20141208115010";}}
