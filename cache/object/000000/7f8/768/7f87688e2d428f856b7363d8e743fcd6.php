Clothes for women who are big on top and fed up with outsize clothes.‚Äù

It was by Mandy Appleyard, who wears a size 8 dress, and has a 30G bust, and she talked about the problems she has finding clothes that fit her properly. According to Mandy, a third of UK women say they have to buy a bigger dress size just to accommodate their bust.

Odyl‚Äôs creator, Gemma Holmes realised that high-street clothes are generally made to fit women who wear a B cup bra, and the only way she could find clothes that didn‚Äôt gape or pull was to buy a much larger size. Deciding it wasn‚Äôt rocket science to create beautiful dresses, jackets, tops and blouses which fit both the hips and the bust, she created Odyl Design. The Odyl secret is in the clever cut and fit, which was carefully developed over 18 months. Odyl clothing is available in D/E and F/G cup sizes and is available in sizes 8 to 16. And even better, the Odyl collection is stylish, affordable and made in beautiful fabric, <a title="Odyl" href="http://bit.ly/15gTYyY" target="_blank">so take a look now</a> and stock up for A/W.

<a title="Bravissimo" href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3772&amp;awinaffid=99908&amp;clickref=&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bravissimo.com%2F" target="_blank">Bravissimo</a> have also created a new collection which offers blouses, tops and dresses for women with bust size DD and above. Called Pepperberry, ¬†the collection is cut generously around the bust, so blouses and jackets don‚Äôt gape and dresses don‚Äôt pull. The clothes are available in size 8-18 and in ‚ÄúCurvy‚Äù, ‚ÄúReally Curvy‚Äù and ‚ÄúSuper Curvy‚Äù fittings.
