Itâ€™s more than the sum of its parts - or ingredients - and is simply something that just clicks right down to your bones.</h2>

Itâ€™s why classic fragrances (those older than, say, 25 years) have lasted so long, because theyâ€™ve had time to successfully click with more women - plus theyâ€™re demonstrably great blends. But itâ€™s also why buying perfume for someone else can be tricky. But if you know which â€˜familyâ€™ your friend/relative/partner already likes, theyâ€™re a good bet for helping them to find their own perfume soul-mate.

Being an aldehydic floral, itâ€™s more like an orchestra than a bouquet of individual notes, but it includes ylang-ylang, jasmine and rose, while the synthetic â€˜aldehydicâ€™ notes ensure that itâ€™s not heady, heavy or cloying. In concentration terms, the Eau De Parfum, Â£60.75 for 50ml, sits between the pure parfum and the Eau de Toilette.

Originally created in 1927, it had a formulation revamp in 1993 but still smells beautifully serene and elegant with neroli, rose, jasmine and lily. Available as perfume, EDP and EDT, the 100ml EDP costs Â£75 from <a title="Harrods" href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=RIYrAqooNEU&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=288002.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=7767&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.harrods.com%252F" target="_blank">Harrods.</a>

Itâ€™s therefore suitably exotic with a complex blend of peach, rose and jasmine blending with spices and mossy woods. The 50ml EDT costs Â£54.

Its amber-rich blend of mandarin, jasmine, carnation, myrrh and vanilla makes it exotic, heady and very, very sexy. A 30ml EDP Natural Spray retails for around Â£48.50.

The award-winning lushly feminine floral-oriental mix of ylang-ylang, iris and jasmine, is sharpened by spices and backed by powdery musk, and you can expect to pay Â£36 for 30ml EDT.

Finally, if the person youâ€™re buying for prefers new, innovative scents, check out those that highlight relatively few dominant ingredients, such as <a title="Jo Malone" href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=99908&amp;clickref=&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fjo-malone-wood-sage-sea-salt-eau-de-cologne-100ml%2Fp1667615" target="_blank">Jo Maloneâ€™s Wood Sage &amp; Sea Salt, Â£82</a>Â or <a title="Creed's Iris Tubereuse" href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3539&amp;awinaffid=99908&amp;clickref=&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.selfridges.com%2Fen%2Fcreed-acqua-originale-iris-tubereuse-eau-de-parfum-100ml_365-83022651-CMAQIRTUB100%2F" target="_blank">Creedâ€™s Iris Tubereuse, Â£165</a>.
